	abstract = {Statins induce antiproliferative effects and apoptotic response in various cancer cell types. Moreover, they also sensitize tumor cell lines from different origins to many agents. We aimed to investigate possible effects of Mevastatin (Mev) alone and sequential treatment of 5′-aza-2-deoxycitidine (DAC) and Mev on HL-60 cell line using XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assay, lactate dehydrogenase release assay, flourescence microscopy, DNA fragmentation analysis, determination of DNA synthesis rate, and active caspase-3 assay. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of apoptotic and antiapoptotic genes were also evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for BAX, BCL2, and XIAP genes and quantitative Real-time PCR for CASP3, CASP8, and CASP9 genes. We showed that treatment with Mev alone and DAC followed by Mev resulted in apoptotic response in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We also found that pretreatment with DAC sensitized HL-60 cells to Mev and caused more apoptotic cell death than Mev-alone treatment via caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, sequential addition of Mev after DAC diminished DNA synthesis rate more effectively than Mev-alone treatment. Furthermore, DAC pretreatment significantly increased CASP3 and CASP9 mRNA expression even with lower doses of Mev. BAX, BCL2, and XIAP gene mRNA levels were also found to be changed in the presence of DAC and Mev. Determination of the exact molecular effects of statins and DAC would allow us to identify new molecular targets to develop more effective treatment regimens for cancer.},

Tcrd and Tcrg display identical developmental programs that depend on the activity of the enhancers Eδ and Eγ being “on” in pre–β-selection thymocytes to activate transcription and V(D)J recombination of the unrearranged genes and “off” in post–β-selection CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes to inhibit transcription of the rearranged genes and avoid the expression of TCR δ- and TCR γ-chains in αβ T lymphocytes. Eδ and Eγ activity depends on transcription factor binding to essential Runx and Myb sites and parallels that of Notch signaling. We performed Notch gain- and loss-of-function experiments and found that Notch signaling activates Tcrd and Tcrg transcription by favoring the recruitment of RUNX1 and MYB to the enhancers. Our results suggest that the dissociation of RUNX1 and MYB from Eδ and Eγ chromatin in double-positive thymocytes, which results in enhancer inactivation, is caused by decreased Notch signaling triggered by pre-TCR signaling, thereby deciphering the molecular mechanism of Tcrd and Tcrg silencing during β-selection. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for gene regulation via Notch signaling through the recruitment of RUNX1 and MYB to enhancer chromatin during thymocyte development.},

	abstract = {A T-cell-specific transcriptional enhancer lies within the J delta 3-C delta intron of the human T-cell receptor (TCR) delta gene. The 30-bp minimal enhancer element denoted delta E3 carries a core sequence (TGTGGTTT) that binds a T-cell-specific factor, and that is necessary but not sufficient for transcriptional activation. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor c-Myb regulates TCR delta enhancer activity through a binding site in delta E3 that is adjacent to the core site. Both v-Myb and c-Myb bind specifically to delta E3. The Myb site is necessary for enhancer activity, because a mutation that eliminates Myb binding abolishes transcriptional activation by the delta E3 element and by the 370-bp TCR delta enhancer. Transfection of cells with a c-Myb expression construct upregulates delta E3 enhancer activity, whereas treatment of cells with an antisense c-myb oligonucleotide inhibits delta E3 enhancer activity. Since intact Myb and core sites are both required for delta E3 function, our data argue that c-Myb and core binding factors must cooperate to mediate transcriptional activation through delta E3. Efficient cooperation depends on the relative positioning of the Myb and core sites, since only one of two overlapping Myb sites within delta E3 is functional and alterations of the distance between this site and the core site disrupt enhancer activity. Cooperative regulation by c-Myb and core-binding factors is likely to play an important role in the control of gene expression during T-cell development.},

	abstract = {Genetic lesions such as BCR–ABL1, E2A–PBX1, and MLL rearrangements (MLLr) are associated with unfavorable outcomes in adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Leukemia oncoproteins may directly or indirectly disrupt cytosine methylation patterning to mediate the malignant phenotype. We postulated that DNA methylation signatures in these aggressive B-ALLs would point toward disease mechanisms and useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We therefore conducted DNA methylation and gene expression profiling on a cohort of 215 adult patients with B-ALL enrolled in a single phase III clinical trial (ECOG E2993) and normal control B cells. In BCR–ABL1-positive B-ALLs, aberrant cytosine methylation patterning centered around a cytokine network defined by hypomethylation and overexpression of IL2RA(CD25). The E2993 trial clinical data showed that CD25 expression was strongly associated with a poor outcome in patients with ALL regardless of BCR–ABL1 status, suggesting CD25 as a novel prognostic biomarker for risk stratification in B-ALLs. In E2A–PBX1-positive B-ALLs, aberrant DNA methylation patterning was strongly associated with direct fusion protein binding as shown by the E2A–PBX1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq), suggesting that E2A–PBX1 fusion protein directly remodels the epigenome to impose an aggressive B-ALL phenotype. MLLr B-ALL featured prominent cytosine hypomethylation, which was linked with MLL fusion protein binding, H3K79 dimethylation, and transcriptional upregulation, affecting a set of known and newly identified MLL fusion direct targets with oncogenic activity such as FLT3 and BCL6. Notably, BCL6 blockade or loss of function suppressed proliferation and survival of MLLr leukemia cells, suggesting BCL6-targeted therapy as a new therapeutic strategy for MLLr B-ALLs.
Significance: We conducted the first integrative epigenomic study in adult B-ALLs, as a correlative study to the ECOG E2993 phase III clinical trial. This study links for the first time the direct actions of oncogenic fusion proteins with disruption of epigenetic regulation mediated by cytosine methylation. We identify a novel clinically actionable biomarker in B-ALLs: IL2RA(CD25), which is linked with BCR–ABL1 and an inflammatory signaling network associated with chemotherapy resistance. We show that BCL6 is a novel MLL fusion protein target that is required to maintain the proliferation and survival of primary human adult MLLr cells and provide the basis for a clinical trial with BCL6 inhibitors for patients with MLLr.

The immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) lenalidomide promotes myeloma cell death via Cereblon (CRBN)-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3. Although IMiDs have been used as first-line drugs for MM, the overall survival of refractory MM patients remains poor and demands the identification of novel agents to potentiate the therapeutic effect of IMiDs. Using an unbiased screen based on mass spectrometry, we identified the Runt-related transcription factor 1 and 3 (RUNX1 and RUNX3) as interactors of IKZF1 and IKZF3. Interaction with RUNX1 and RUNX3 inhibits CRBN-dependent binding, ubiquitylation, and degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 upon lenalidomide treatment. Inhibition of RUNXs, via genetic ablation or a small molecule (AI-10-104), results in sensitization of myeloma cell lines and primary tumors to lenalidomide. Thus, RUNX inhibition represents a valuable therapeutic opportunity to potentiate IMiDs therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma.},

	abstract = {B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) prevents commitment to programmed cell death at the mitochondrion. It remains a challenge to identify those tumors that are best treated by inhibition of BCL-2. Here, we demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, primary patient samples, and murine primary xenografts are very sensitive to treatment with the selective BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199. In primary patient cells, the median IC50 was approximately 10 nmol/L, and cell death occurred within 2 hours. Our ex vivo sensitivity results compare favorably with those observed for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disease for which ABT-199 has demonstrated consistent activity in clinical trials. Moreover, mitochondrial studies using BH3 profiling demonstrate activity at the mitochondrion that correlates well with cytotoxicity, supporting an on-target mitochondrial mechanism of action. Our protein and BH3 profiling studies provide promising tools that can be tested as predictive biomarkers in any clinical trial of ABT-199 in AML.
Significance: Although targeting BCL-2 has largely been investigated in lymphoid cancers, we present preclinical results of targeting BCL-2 in AML. These results support clinical testing of the small-molecule BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199 in AML, accompanied by testing of predictive biomarkers used in this study.

	abstract = {To study mechanisms underlying resistance to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we used a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify gene knockouts resulting in drug resistance. We validated TP53, BAX, and PMAIP1 as genes whose inactivation results in venetoclax resistance in AML cell lines. Resistance to venetoclax resulted from an inability to execute apoptosis driven by BAX loss, decreased expression of BCL2, and/or reliance on alternative BCL2 family members such as BCL2L1. The resistance was accompanied by changes in mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular metabolism. Evaluation of TP53 knockout cells for sensitivities to a panel of small-molecule inhibitors revealed a gain of sensitivity to TRK inhibitors. We relate these observations to patient drug responses and gene expression in the Beat AML dataset. Our results implicate TP53, the apoptotic network, and mitochondrial functionality as drivers of venetoclax response in AML and suggest strategies to overcome resistance.
Significance: AML is challenging to treat due to its heterogeneity, and single-agent therapies have universally failed, prompting a need for innovative drug combinations. We used a genetic approach to identify genes whose inactivation contributes to drug resistance as a means of forming preferred drug combinations to improve AML treatment.See related commentary by Savona and Rathmell, p. 831.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813},

	abstract = {Although the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is successfully used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), inherent mechanisms confer primary resistance to leukemic patients. In order to search for potentially useful genes in predicting cytogenetic response, a retrospective gene expression study was performed. Leukocyte RNA isolated before imatinib from interferon-alpha-pretreated chronic phase CML patients (n=34) with or without major cytogenetic remission (⩽35\% Philadelphia (Ph)+ metaphases) during the first year of treatment was comparatively analyzed using Affymetrix U133A chips. Using support vector machines for gene classification, an outcome-specific gene expression signature consisting of 128 genes was identified. Comparative expression data of specific genes point to changes in apoptosis (e.g. casp9, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1, hras), DNA repair (msh3, ddb2), oxidative stress protection (glutathione synthetase, paraoxonase 2, vanin 1) and centrosomes (inhibitor of differentiation-1) within primary resistant patients. Independent statistical approaches and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies support the clinical relevance of gene profiling. In conclusion, this study establishes a candidate predictor of imatinib resistance in interferon-alpha-pretreated CML patients to be subjected to future investigation in a larger independent patient cohort. The resulting expression signature point to involvement of BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of resistance.},

Furthermore, by using a curated list of census cancer genes, we find an enrichment in these functional modules.

	abstract = {Despite the development of numerous gene regulatory network (GRN) inference methods in the last years, their application, usage and the biological significance of the resulting GRN remains unclear for our general understanding of large-scale gene expression data in routine practice. In our study, we conduct a structural and a functional analysis of B-cell lymphoma GRNs that were inferred using 3 mutual information-based GRN inference methods: C3Net, BC3Net and Aracne. From a comparative analysis on the global level, we find that the inferred B-cell lymphoma GRNs show major differences. However, on the edge-level and the functional-level - that are more important for our biological understanding - the B-cell lymphoma GRNs were highly similar among each other. Also, the ranks of the degree centrality values and major hub genes in the inferred networks are highly conserved as well. Interestingly, the major hub genes of all GRNs are associated with the G-protein-coupled receptor pathway, cell-cell signaling and cell cycle. This implies that hub genes of the GRNs can be highly consistently inferred with C3Net, BC3Net and Aracne, representing prominent targets for signaling pathways. Finally, we describe the functional and structural relationship between C3Net, BC3Net and Aracne gene regulatory networks. Our study shows that these GRNs that are inferred from large-scale gene expression data are promising for the identification of novel candidate interactions and pathways that play a key role in the underlying mechanisms driving cancer hallmarks. Overall, our comparative analysis reveals that these GRNs inferred with considerably different inference methods contain large amounts of consistent, method independent, biological information.},

We describe a method, PANTHER, for relating protein sequence relationships to function relationships in a robust and accurate way. PANTHER is composed of two main components: the PANTHER library (PANTHER/LIB) and the PANTHER index (PANTHER/X). PANTHER/LIB is a collection of “books,” each representing a protein family as a multiple sequence alignment, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and a family tree. Functional divergence within the family is represented by dividing the tree into subtrees based on shared function, and by subtree HMMs. PANTHER/X is an abbreviated ontology for summarizing and navigating molecular functions and biological processes associated with the families and subfamilies. We apply PANTHER to three areas of active research. First, we report the size and sequence diversity of the families and subfamilies, characterizing the relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence across a wide range of protein families. Second, we use the PANTHER/X ontology to give a high-level representation of gene function across the human and mouse genomes. Third, we use the family HMMs to rank missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), on a database-wide scale, according to their likelihood of affecting protein function.},

While it is established that all proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins bind and neutralize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, how this neutralization leads to Bax/Bak activation has been actively debated. Here, genome editing was used to generate cells deficient for all eight proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (OctaKO) and those that lack the entire Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2 allKO). Although the OctaKO cells were resistant to most apoptotic stimuli tested, they underwent Bax/Bak-dependent and p53/Rb-independent apoptosis efficiently when both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, two anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, were inactivated or eliminated. Strikingly, when expressed in the Bcl-2 allKO cells, both Bax and Bak spontaneously associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and this association triggered their homo-oligomerization/activation. Together, these results strongly suggest that the OMM, not BH3-only proteins or p53/Rb, is the long-sought-after direct activator of Bax/Bak following BH3-only-mediated neutralization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.},

To understand these complex wiring diagrams1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,13, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks2. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli3,6. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.},

In vitro studies have suggested that there are in the dorsal aorta a population of intermediate progenitors that can give rise to both endothelial (or blood vessel lineage) and blood cells. In this issue, two groups present images showing the birth of HSCs from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta in live zebrafish embryos. Bertrand et al. combined fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry to identify and isolate the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs. They also show that the HSCs generated from this haemogenic endothelium are the lineal founders of virtually all of the adult haematopoietic system. Karima Kissa and Philippe Herbomel similarly use imaging of live zebrafish to show HSCs emerge directly from the aorta floor, They show this process that does not involve cell division but movement of single endothelial cells out of the aorta ventral wall into the sub-aortic space, where they transform into haematopoietic cells. They call this new type of cell behaviour endothelial haematopoietic transition (EHT). In a third report, Boisset et al. confirm that this process also occurs in mice, using a dissection procedure to visualize the deeply located aorta. They showed de novo emergence of phenotypically defined HSCs directly from ventral aortic haemogenic endothelial cells.},

	abstract = {Splice-modulation therapy, whereby molecular manipulation of premessenger RNA splicing is engineered to yield genetic correction, is a promising novel therapy for genetic diseases of muscle and nerve—the prototypical example being Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common childhood genetic disease, affecting one in 3500 newborn boys, causing progressive muscle weakness, heart and respiratory failure and premature death. No cure exists for this disease and a number of promising new molecular therapies are being intensively studied. Duchenne muscular dystrophy arises due to mutations that disrupt the open-reading-frame in the DMD gene leading to the absence of the essential muscle protein dystrophin. Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as ‘exon skipping’ or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced. Recently this method was shown to be promising and safe in clinical trials both in The Netherlands and the UK. These trials studied direct antisense oligonucleotide injections into single peripheral lower limb muscles, whereas a viable therapy will need antisense oligonucleotides to be delivered systemically to all muscles, most critically to the heart, and ultimately to all other affected tissues including brain. There has also been considerable progress in understanding how such splice-correction methods could be applied to the treatment of related neuromuscular diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy, where defects of splicing or alternative splicing are closely related to the disease mechanism.},

	abstract = {Chaos should occur often in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) which have been widely described by nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations, if their dimensions are no less than 3. It is therefore puzzling that chaos has never been reported in GRNs in nature and is also extremely rare in models of GRNs. On the other hand, the topic of motifs has attracted great attention in studying biological networks, and network motifs are suggested to be elementary building blocks that carry out some key functions in the network. In this paper, chaotic motifs (subnetworks with chaos) in GRNs are systematically investigated. The conclusion is that: (i) chaos can only appear through competitions between different oscillatory modes with rivaling intensities. Conditions required for chaotic GRNs are found to be very strict, which make chaotic GRNs extremely rare. (ii) Chaotic motifs are explored as the simplest few-node structures capable of producing chaos, and serve as the intrinsic source of chaos of random few-node GRNs. Several optimal motifs causing chaos with atypically high probability are figured out. (iii) Moreover, we discovered that a number of special oscillators can never produce chaos. These structures bring some advantages on rhythmic functions and may help us understand the robustness of diverse biological rhythms. (iv) The methods of dominant phase-advanced driving (DPAD) and DPAD time fraction are proposed to quantitatively identify chaotic motifs and to explain the origin of chaotic behaviors in GRNs.},

To identify transcription factors that regulate CD133 expression, we conducted parallel large-scale RNA interference screens in Caco-2 cancer cells that endogenously express CD133 and in engineered HEK293 cells that express CD133 from a heterologous promoter. The transcription factor AF4 was identified following a comparative analysis between the two screens. We then showed that AF4 is a promoter of CD133 transcription in multiple cancer cell lines. Knockdown of AF4 resulted in a dramatic reduction in CD133 transcript levels. Importantly, a subset of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) harbor a fusion oncogene results from a chromosomal translocation that juxtaposes the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene and the AF4 gene. An investigation of the functional role of CD133 in the MLL-AF4–dependent ALL cells revealed that CD133 was required for leukemia cell survival. Together, our findings show AF4-dependent regulation of CD133 expression, which is required for the growth of ALL cells. CD133 may therefore represent a therapeutic target in a subset of cancers.

However, there has not been systematic characterization of target promoters for these potential enhancers.

Among the 6 520 long-distance chromatin interactions, we identify 2 067 enhancers that interact with 1 619 promoters and enhance their expression. These enhancers exist in accessible chromatin regions and are associated with various histone modifications and polymerase II binding. The promoters with interacting enhancers are expressed at higher levels than those without interacting enhancers, and their expression levels are positively correlated with the number of interacting enhancers. Interestingly, interacting promoters are co-expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We also find that chromosomes are organized into multiple levels of interacting domains. Our results define a global view of EP interactions and provide a data set to further understand mechanisms of enhancer targeting and long-range chromatin organization.

We performed RNA-seq and histone mark ChIP-seq to define the transcriptomes and epigenomes of cells representing key developmental stages of HSC ontogeny in mice. The five populations analyzed were embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) endothelium and hemogenic endothelium from the major arteries, an enriched population of prehematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs), fetal liver HSCs, and adult bone marrow HSCs. Using epigenetic signatures, we identified enhancers for each developmental stage. Only 12\% of enhancers are primed, and 78\% are active, suggesting the vast majority of enhancers are established de novo without prior priming in earlier stages. We constructed developmental stage-specific transcriptional regulatory networks by linking enhancers and predicted bound transcription factors to their target promoters using a novel computational algorithm, target inference via physical connection (TIPC). TIPC predicted known transcriptional regulators for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, validating our overall approach, and identified putative novel transcription factors, including the broadly expressed transcription factors SP3 and MAZ. Finally, we validated a role for SP3 and MAZ in the formation of hemogenic endothelium. Our data and computational analyses provide a useful resource for uncovering regulators of HSC formation.},

Their gene-expression programmes become more defined, restricted and, potentially, 'locked in'. Pluripotent stem cells express genes that encode a set of core transcription factors, while genes that are required later in development are repressed by histone marks, which confer short-term, and therefore flexible, epigenetic silencing. By contrast, the methylation of DNA confers long-term epigenetic silencing of particular sequences — transposons, imprinted genes and pluripotency-associated genes — in somatic cells. Long-term silencing can be reprogrammed by demethylation of DNA, and this process might involve DNA repair. It is not known whether any of the epigenetic marks has a primary role in determining cell and lineage commitment during development.},

	abstract = {MLL gene rearrangements (MLLr) are a common cause of aggressive, incurable acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) in infants and children, most of which originate in utero. The most common MLLr produces an MLL-AF4 fusion protein. MLL-AF4 promotes leukemogenesis by activating key target genes, mainly through recruitment of DOT1L and increased histone H3 lysine-79 methylation (H3K79me2/3). One key MLL-AF4 target gene is PROM1, which encodes CD133 (Prominin-1). CD133 is a pentaspan transmembrane glycoprotein that represents a potential pan-cancer target as it is found on multiple cancer stem cells. Here we demonstrate that aberrant PROM1/CD133 expression is essential for leukemic cell growth, mediated by direct binding of MLL-AF4. Activation is controlled by an intragenic H3K79me2/3 enhancer element (KEE) leading to increased enhancer–promoter interactions between PROM1 and the nearby gene TAPT1. This dual locus regulation is reflected in a strong correlation of expression in leukemia. We find that in PROM1/CD133 non-expressing cells, the PROM1 locus is repressed by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) binding, associated with reduced expression of TAPT1, partially due to loss of interactions with the PROM1 locus. Together, these results provide the first detailed analysis of PROM1/CD133 regulation that explains CD133 expression in MLLr ALL.},

Venetoclax, a selective BCL2 inhibitor, has received FDA approval for the treatment of AML. However, drug resistance ensues after prolonged treatment, highlighting the need for a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human AML, we identified genes whose inactivation sensitizes AML blasts to venetoclax. Genes involved in mitochondrial organization and function were significantly depleted throughout our screen, including the mitochondrial chaperonin \textit{CLPB}. We demonstrated that CLPB is upregulated in human AML, it is further induced upon acquisition of venetoclax resistance, and its ablation sensitizes AML to venetoclax. Mechanistically, CLPB maintains the mitochondrial cristae structure via its interaction with the cristae-shaping protein OPA1, whereas its loss promotes apoptosis by inducing cristae remodeling and mitochondrial stress responses. Overall, our data suggest that targeting mitochondrial architecture may provide a promising approach to circumvent venetoclax resistance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Significance:{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen reveals genes involved in mitochondrial biological processes participate in the acquisition of venetoclax resistance.

	abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics techniques have opened the door to the study of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) at the single-cell level. Here, we studied the GRNs controlling the emergence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from mouse embryonic endothelium using a combination of single-cell transcriptome assays. We found that a heptad of transcription factors (Runx1, Gata2, Tal1, Fli1, Lyl1, Erg and Lmo2) is specifically co-expressed in an intermediate population expressing both endothelial and hematopoietic markers. Within the heptad, we identified two sets of factors of opposing functions: one (Erg/Fli1) promoting the endothelial cell fate, the other (Runx1/Gata2) promoting the hematopoietic fate. Surprisingly, our data suggest that even though Fli1 initially supports the endothelial cell fate, it acquires a pro-hematopoietic role when co-expressed with Runx1. This work demonstrates the power of single-cell RNA-sequencing for characterizing complex transcription factor dynamics.},

At first glance it might seem counterintuitive that MYC is also among the most robust agents of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in mammalian cells. However it is clearly beneficial for a multicellular organism to have a mechanism for triggering death in cells that express potentially oncogenic levels of MYC. Decades of intense study have begun to provide an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate MYC’s seemingly split personality. Key features of MYC-induced apoptosis will be discussed here along with examples of how our understanding of this pathway might be exploited for the therapeutic benefit of cancer patients.},

However, when cells were treated with DAC and infected with a low dose of a recombinant wild-type p53 adenovirus vector (Ad-p53), a synergistic growth inhibitory effect was observed. Combination treatment induced Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 expression in which cytochrome c releases by Ad-p53 triggered the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Selective blockage of caspase-9 activities by Z-LEHD-FMK completely attenuated DAC-induced enhancement of apoptosis mediated by Ad-p53 infection, and ectopic overexpression of procaspase-9 sensitized cells to Ad-p53-induced apoptosis in p53-null cells. In addition, DAC sensitized lung cancer cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel. Induction of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis using a slightly toxic dose of DAC may therefore be a strategy for treating lung cancer, and DAC treatment may have clinical implications when combined with chemotherapy or apoptosis-inducing gene therapy.},

The expression of CAT in pMyc2CAT-transformed cells declined fivefold after 24 h in the presence of RA, returned to the normal level within 48 h, and decreased again to below 20\% of the normal level after 96 h. By contrast, the expression of CAT in pMyc1CAT-transformed cells did not return to the normal level after 48 h in the presence of RA. In addition, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with ME1a1 DNA as probe demonstrated that the kinetics of the DNA-binding activity of MAZ were closely correlated with the changes in the expression of CAT from the c-myc promoter/CAT gene during the differentiation of P19EC cells. Taken together, these results suggest that MAZ plays a key role in the transient increase in the expression of the c-myc gene after 48 h of exposure to RA during the neuroectodermal differentiation of P19EC cells.},

Here, we show that leukemia cells require the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex for their survival and aberrant self-renewal potential. While Brg1, an ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF, is known to suppress tumor formation in several cell types, we found that leukemia cells instead rely on Brg1 to support their oncogenic transcriptional program, which includes Myc as one of its key targets. To account for this context-specific function, we identify a cluster of lineage-specific enhancers located 1.7 Mb downstream from Myc that are occupied by SWI/SNF as well as the BET protein Brd4. Brg1 is required at these distal elements to maintain transcription factor occupancy and for long-range chromatin looping interactions with the Myc promoter. Notably, these distal Myc enhancers coincide with a region that is focally amplified in ∼3\% of acute myeloid leukemias. Together, these findings define a leukemia maintenance function for SWI/SNF that is linked to enhancer-mediated gene regulation, providing general insights into how cancer cells exploit transcriptional coactivators to maintain oncogenic gene expression programs.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor RUNX1 is a critical regulator of developmental hematopoiesis and is frequently disrupted in leukemia. Runx1 is a large, complex gene that is expressed from two alternative promoters under the spatiotemporal control of multiple hematopoietic enhancers. To dissect the dynamic regulation of Runx1 in hematopoietic development, we analyzed its three-dimensional chromatin conformation in mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation cultures. Runx1 resides in a 1.1 Mb topologically associating domain (TAD) demarcated by convergent CTCF motifs. As ESCs differentiate to mesoderm, chromatin accessibility, Runx1 enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions, and CTCF-CTCF interactions increase in the TAD, along with initiation of Runx1 expression from the P2 promoter. Differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells is associated with the formation of tissue-specific sub-TADs over Runx1, a shift in E-P interactions, P1 promoter demethylation, and robust expression from both Runx1 promoters. Deletion of promoter-proximal CTCF sites at the sub-TAD boundaries has no obvious effects on E-P interactions but leads to partial loss of domain structure, mildly affects gene expression, and delays hematopoietic development. Together, our analysis of gene regulation at a large multi-promoter developmental gene reveals that dynamic sub-TAD chromatin boundaries play a role in establishing TAD structure and coordinated gene expression.},

	abstract = {Although 90\% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are now cured, the prognosis for infant-ALL remains dismal. Infant-ALL is usually caused by a single genetic hit that arises in utero: an MLL/KMT2A gene rearrangement (MLL-r). This is sufficient to induce a uniquely aggressive and treatment-refractory leukemia compared to older children. The reasons for disparate outcomes in patients of different ages with identical driver mutations are unknown. Using the most common MLL-r in infant-ALL, MLL-AF4, as a disease model, we show that fetal-specific gene expression programs are maintained in MLL-AF4 infant-ALL but not in MLL-AF4 childhood-ALL. We use CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of primary human fetal liver hematopoietic cells to produce a t(4;11)/MLL-AF4 translocation, which replicates the clinical features of infant-ALL and drives infant-ALL-specific and fetal-specific gene expression programs. These data support the hypothesis that fetal-specific gene expression programs cooperate with MLL-AF4 to initiate and maintain the distinct biology of infant-ALL.},

	abstract = {Genetic studies during the past decades have revealed tightly regulated transcriptional networks that control robust developmental programs. However, this deterministic view of development contrasts with recent genomic studies that suggest that the multiple steps of transcription are by themselves rather leaky.Although any single transcription factor (TF) can typically bind to thousands of sites throughout the genome, cis-regulatory activity at enhancers requires the concerted action of multiple binding events (which can be homotypic or heterotypic).TFs bind to enhancers in a combinatorial manner, which is facilitated through direct and indirect cooperative mechanisms. The combinatorial nature of enhancer occupancy allows genes to be regulated in complex patterns in both space and time.DNA and proteins can act together as a scaffold to cooperatively recruit TFs to enhancers.Enhancers undergo progressive changes during development, in which their occupancy by TFs, and the position of nucleosomes with or without post-translational modifications, reflect their inactive, poised or active state.Pioneer TFs recruit chromatin-remodelling factors to reposition nucleosomes, thus facilitating the occupancy of other TFs at subsequent developmental stages.Enhancer priming can occur through many different mechanisms. For example, some TF binding events may serve as placeholders to prevent nucleosome repositioning.Partially redundant enhancers can act to buffer changes in environmental conditions to ensure robust developmental progression.Multiple elements regulating the same gene seem to assemble in a three-dimensional structure with the promoter, and can have synergistic or repressive influences on each other.},

We identify ∼350 genetic interactions between genes functioning in signaling pathways that are mutated in human diseases, including components of the EGF/Ras, Notch and Wnt pathways. Most notably, we identify a class of highly connected 'hub' genes: inactivation of these genes can enhance the phenotypic consequences of mutation of many different genes. These hub genes all encode chromatin regulators, and their activity as genetic hubs seems to be conserved across animals. We propose that these genes function as general buffers of genetic variation and that these hub genes may act as modifier genes in multiple, mechanistically unrelated genetic diseases in humans.},

	abstract = {A basic function of the Mediator complex is to communicate regulatory signals from DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) directly to RNA polymerase II (Pol II).Different TFs, and the signalling pathways that regulate these TFs, often interact with different Mediator subunits to regulate expression of their target genes.Mediator is composed of a large number of subunits, some of which can reversibly associate with Mediator or are expressed at variable levels in different cell types.Mediator binding to various proteins and protein complexes, such as TFs, Pol II and the cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) module, results in large-scale structural changes. These structural changes, in turn, appear to modulate the function of Mediator and may affect its ability to bind to other proteins.Because of its direct and extensive interactions with Pol II, Mediator regulates multiple stages of Pol II transcription (for example, initiation and re-initiation). Mediator interactions with the super elongation complex (SEC) also seem to be important for its regulation of Pol II elongation.The interactions between TFs, Mediator, cohesin and the pre-initiation complex (PIC) correlate with the formation of enhancer–promoter DNA loops, which are an important regulatory mechanism. Interactions between Mediator and non-coding RNA also correlate with DNA looping.},

They enable the highly regulated transcription of genes by selectively integrating regulatory cues from distal enhancers and their associated regulatory proteins. In this Review, we discuss the defining properties of gene core promoters, including their sequence features, chromatin architecture and transcription initiation patterns. We provide an overview of molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of core promoters and their emerging functional diversity, which defines distinct transcription programmes. On the basis of the established properties of gene core promoters, we discuss transcription start sites within enhancers and integrate recent results obtained from dedicated functional assays to propose a functional model of transcription initiation. This model can explain the nature and function of transcription initiation at gene starts and at enhancers and can explain the different roles of core promoters, of Pol II and its associated factors and of the activating cues provided by enhancers and the transcription factors and cofactors they recruit.},

The organization of accessible chromatin across the genome reflects a network of permissible physical interactions through which enhancers, promoters, insulators and chromatin-binding factors cooperatively regulate gene expression. This landscape of accessibility changes dynamically in response to both external stimuli and developmental cues, and emerging evidence suggests that homeostatic maintenance of accessibility is itself dynamically regulated through a competitive interplay between chromatin-binding factors and nucleosomes. In this Review, we examine how the accessible genome is measured and explore the role of transcription factors in initiating accessibility remodelling; our goal is to illustrate how chromatin accessibility defines regulatory elements within the genome and how these epigenetic features are dynamically established to control gene expression.},

Repetitive DNA from intragenomic parasites is heavily methylated, which allows transcription of the host gene at the same time as preventing transcription initiation of the repetitive DNA.Methylation of control regions outside of the transcription start sites — such as enhancers and insulators — is increasingly being recognized as being functionally important.Demethylation of DNA is now accepted as being essential for embryonic development and seems to occur mainly in regions of DNA that are not CpG islands; thus, methylation patterns are increasingly being realized as being far more dynamic than previously recognized.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in {\textless}2 h.},

        , The first definitive hematopoietic stem cells (dHSCs) in the mouse emerge in the dorsal aorta of the embryonic day (E) 10.5 to 11 aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Notch signaling is essential for early HSC development but is dispensable for the maintenance of adult bone marrow HSCs. How Notch signaling regulates HSC formation in the embryo is poorly understood. We demonstrate here that Notch signaling is active in E10.5 HSC precursors and involves both Notch1 and Notch2 receptors, but is gradually downregulated while they progress toward dHSCs at E11.5. This downregulation is accompanied by gradual functional loss of Notch dependency. Thus, as early as at final steps in the AGM region, HSCs begin acquiring the Notch independency characteristic of adult bone marrow HSCs as part of the maturation program. Our data indicate that fine stage-dependent tuning of Notch signaling may be required for the generation of definitive HSCs from pluripotent cells.},

We highlight the core mechanisms of BCL-2 family regulation of MOMP with an emphasis on how the interactions between the BCL-2 family proteins govern cell fate. We address the critical importance of both the concentration and affinities of BCL-2 family proteins and show how differences in either can greatly change the outcome. Further, we explain the importance of using full-length BCL-2 family proteins (versus truncated versions or peptides) to parse out the core mechanisms of MOMP regulation by the BCL-2 family. Finally, we discuss how post-translational modifications and differing intracellular localizations alter the mechanisms of apoptosis regulation by BCL-2 family proteins. Successful therapeutic intervention of MOMP regulation in human disease requires an understanding of the factors that mediate the major binding interactions between BCL-2 family proteins in cells.},

Other sources of information, including mRNA expression, genetic interactions and database annotations, are subsequently used to validate the model predictions without bias or cross-pollution. Novel topological statistics show hierarchical organization of the network of high-confidence interactions: protein complex interactions extend one to two links, and genetic interactions represent an even finer scale of organization. Knowledge of the maximum number of links that indicates a significant correlation between protein pairs (correlation distance) enables the integrated analysis of proteomics data with data from genetics and gene expression.

In search for human silencers, we utilized H3K27me3-DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) peaks with tissue specificity negatively correlated with the expression of nearby genes across 25 diverse cell lines. These regions are predicted to be silencers since they are physically linked, using Hi-C loops, or associated, using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) results, with a decrease in gene expression much more frequently than general H3K27me3-DHSs. Also, these regions are enriched for the binding sites of transcriptional repressors (such as CTCF, MECOM, SMAD4, and SNAI3) and depleted of the binding sites of transcriptional activators. Using sequence signatures of these regions, we constructed a computational model and predicted approximately 10,000 additional silencers per cell line and demonstrated that the majority of genes linked to these silencers are expressed at a decreased level. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in predicted silencers are significantly associated with disease phenotypes. Finally, our results show that silencers commonly interact with enhancers to affect the transcriptional dynamics of tissue-specific genes and to facilitate fine-tuning of transcription in the human genome.},

We have assayed the transcriptional activities of wild-type Kr protein as well as Lac repressor/Kr fusion proteins in HeLa and CV-1 cells. Wild-type Kr and a Lac–Kr chimaeric protein repressed transcription from reporter promoters in which a consensus Kr binding site derived from sequences within the even-skipped promoter5 had been inserted in an upstream position. We mapped the repression function of Kr to an alanine-rich amino-terminal region of the protein, as a Lac/Kr fusion protein containing only amino acids 26–110 of Kr repressed transcription from a reporter promoter containing upstream lac operators. This demonstrates that the DNA-binding and repression activities of the Kr protein are distinct. These data are consistent with genetic evidence that Kr represses even-skipped6,7 and hunchback8 expression, and suggest that Kr is a negative regulator of transcription in Drosophila.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in adults are believed to be born from hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) in mid-gestational embryos. Due to the rare and transient nature, the HSC-competent HECs have never been stringently identified and accurately captured, let alone their genuine vascular precursors. Here, we first used high-precision single-cell transcriptomics to unbiasedly examine the relevant EC populations at continuous developmental stages with intervals of 0.5 days from embryonic day (E) 9.5 to E11.0. As a consequence, we transcriptomically identified two molecularly different arterial EC populations and putative HSC-primed HECs, whose number peaked at E10.0 and sharply decreased thereafter, in the dorsal aorta of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Combining computational prediction and in vivo functional validation, we precisely captured HSC-competent HECs by the newly constructed Neurl3-EGFP reporter mouse model, and realized the enrichment further by a combination of surface markers (Procr+Kit+CD44+, PK44). Surprisingly, the endothelial-hematopoietic dual potential was rarely but reliably witnessed in the cultures of single HECs. Noteworthy, primitive vascular ECs from E8.0 experienced two-step fate choices to become HSC-primed HECs, namely an initial arterial fate choice followed by a hemogenic fate conversion. This finding resolves several previously observed contradictions. Taken together, comprehensive understanding of endothelial evolutions and molecular programs underlying HSC-primed HEC specification in vivo will facilitate future investigations directing HSC production in vitro.},

This issue is best addressed by measuring cell-lineage relationships rather than cell potentials. To undertake long-term in vivo tracing of yolk sac cells, we designed a non-invasive pulse-labelling system based on Cre/loxP recombination. Here we show that in Runx1+/- (runt-related transcription factor 1) heterozygous mice, yolk sac cells expressing Runx1 at embryonic day 7.5 develop into fetal lymphoid progenitors and adult HSCs. During mid-gestation the labelled (embryonic day 7.5) yolk sac cells colonize the umbilical cord, the AGM region and subsequently the embryonic liver. This raises the possibility that some HSCs associated with major embryonic vasculature are derived from yolk sac precursors. We observed virtually no contribution of the labelled cells towards the yolk sac vasculature, indicating early segregation of endothelial and haematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {A functional immunoglobulin gene is formed by the fusion of individual coding elements which are widely separated in germ-line DNA. For the mouse κ light chain gene, this is accomplished by DNA rearrangement which brings one of a large repertoire of non-allelic variable region (Vκ) genes into apposition with one of four junctional (Jκ) elements located 2.7–3.9 kilobases (kb) upstream from the κ constant region coding sequence (Cκ)1–4. Transcription is initiated near the 5′ end of the rearranged Vκ locus, and spans all three coding elements and the large intervening sequence between Jκ and Cκ, and a smaller intervening sequence within the Vκ gene5. Little is known of the mechanisms which control the expression of rearranged immunoglobulin genes. We have studied the process of κ light chain gene activation in a mouse leukaemia cell line, 70Z/3, which synthesizes a κ-type light chain protein in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here we describe changes in the chromatin structure of the κ genes occurring as a result of LPS treatment, and present evidence that a discrete region located inside the large intervening sequence of the κ transcription unit plays a part in κ gene activation.},

They interact with Argonaute proteins through an amino-terminal domain and with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) through a carboxy-terminal silencing domain.Current models suggest that GW182 proteins interfere with PABPC function in translation and/or mRNA stabilization and promote mRNA deadenylation.A remaining open question is whether silencing of miRNA targets can be entirely attributed to deadenylation or whether additional mechanisms are involved in repressing protein production.Moreover, the contribution of translational repression to silencing in plants remains unknown.},

	abstract = {The development of all organisms relies on differential gene expression, which is controlled by genomic regions called enhancers or cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). Recent studies highlight the importance of enhancers in evolution and disease; however, our understanding of their properties and functions remains incomplete.Enhancers contain short DNA sequences, which are binding sites for transcription factors. In turn, transcription factors recruit cofactors, which modify the nearby chromatin and lead to transcriptional activation.The location of putative enhancers can be predicted genome wide by assessing either the binding of transcription factors and cofactors or post-translational histone modifications by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP–seq). 'Open' chromatin with accessible DNA can be detected by DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing (DNase-seq), micrococcal nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq), formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements followed by deep sequencing (FAIRE–seq) or assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq).Distal enhancers can activate target gene expression by looping to promoters. Such spatial contacts can be detected by chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays and its variants circular chromosome conformation capture (4C), chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) and Hi-C methods or by chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA–PET, which is a combination of ChIP and various 3C-based methods).The genome-wide prediction of enhancers based on characteristic chromatin features is powerful, but such results have to be interpreted with caution because none of the known features is perfectly predictive.Enhancer activities of candidate sequences can be measured directly in a developmental context using image-based readouts or enhancer-FACS-seq. High-throughput parallel enhancer assays use either ectopic reporters to test thousands of candidates (which are based on DNA barcodes) or genome-wide screens (such as self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq)).Our understanding of enhancer biology will be further accelerated by advances in genome editing methods (such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)–Cas9 system), as well as by the development or improvements of methods to assess gene expression, chromatin state and structure in entire genomes and from increasingly few cells (such as thousands of reporters integrated in parallel (TRIP), single-cell RNA sequencing or ChIP–seq, and high-resolution Hi-C).},

Although it is well established that RUNX1 is essential for the onset of hematopoiesis, little is known about the role of RUNX1 dosage specifically in hemogenic endothelium and during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. Here, we used the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation system to determine if and how RUNX1 dosage affects hemogenic endothelium differentiation. The use of inducible Runx1 expression combined with alterations in the expression of the RUNX1 co-factor CBFβ allowed us to evaluate a wide range of RUNX1 levels. We demonstrate that low RUNX1 levels are sufficient and necessary to initiate an effective endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. Subsequently, RUNX1 is also required to complete the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition and to generate functional hematopoietic precursors. In contrast, elevated levels of RUNX1 are able to drive an accelerated endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, but the resulting cells are unable to generate mature hematopoietic cells. Together, our results suggest that RUNX1 dosage plays a pivotal role in hemogenic endothelium maturation and the establishment of the hematopoietic system., Summary: At the onset of hematopoiesis, regulation of RUNX1 dosage is crucial for the successful maturation of hemogenic endothelium and for both the initiation and completion of the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition.},

	abstract = {GATA-3 expression is crucial for T cell development and peaks during commitment to the T-cell lineage, midway through the CD4−CD8− (DN) 1-3 stages. We used RNA interference and conditional deletion to reduce GATA-3 protein acutely at specific points during T-cell differentiation in vitro. Even moderate GATA-3 reduction killed DN1 cells, delayed progression to DN2 stage, skewed DN2 gene regulation, and blocked appearance of DN3 phenotype. Although a Bcl-2 transgene rescued DN1 survival and improved DN2 cell generation, it did not restore DN3 differentiation. Gene expression analyses (qPCR, RNA-seq) showed that GATA-3-deficient DN2 cells quickly upregulated genes including Spi1 (PU.1) and Bcl11a and downregulated genes including Cpa3, Ets1, Zfpm1, Bcl11b, Il9r and Il17rb, with gene-specific kinetics and dose-dependencies. These targets could mediate two distinct roles played by GATA-3 in lineage commitment, as revealed by removing wildtype or GATA-3-deficient early T-lineage cells from environmental Notch signals. GATA-3 worked as a potent repressor of B-cell potential even at low expression levels, so that only full deletion of GATA-3 enabled pro-T cells to reveal B-cell potential. The ability of GATA-3 to block B-cell development did not require T-lineage commitment factor Bcl11b. In prethymic multipotent precursors, however, titration of GATA-3 activity using tamoxifen-inducible GATA-3 showed that GATA-3 inhibits B and myeloid developmental alternatives at different threshold doses. Furthermore, differential impacts of a GATA-3 obligate repressor construct imply that B and myeloid development are inhibited through distinct transcriptional mechanisms. Thus, the pattern of GATA-3 expression sequentially produces B-lineage exclusion, T-lineage progression, and myeloid-lineage exclusion for commitment.},

Systematic integrative analysis can help meet this need, and the VISION project was established for validated systematic integration of epigenomic data in hematopoiesis. Here, we systematically integrated extensive data recording epigenetic features and transcriptomes from many sources, including individual laboratories and consortia, to produce a comprehensive view of the regulatory landscape of differentiating hematopoietic cell types in mouse. By using IDEAS as our integrative and discriminative epigenome annotation system, we identified and assigned epigenetic states simultaneously along chromosomes and across cell types, precisely and comprehensively. Combining nuclease accessibility and epigenetic states produced a set of more than 200,000 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) that efficiently capture enhancers and promoters. The transitions in epigenetic states of these cCREs across cell types provided insights into mechanisms of regulation, including decreases in numbers of active cCREs during differentiation of most lineages, transitions from poised to active or inactive states, and shifts in nuclease accessibility of CTCF-bound elements. Regression modeling of epigenetic states at cCREs and gene expression produced a versatile resource to improve selection of cCREs potentially regulating target genes. These resources are available from our VISION website to aid research in genomics and hematopoiesis.},

A model is emerging for the transcription of protein-coding genes in which distinct transient condensates form at gene promoters and in gene bodies to concentrate the factors required for transcription initiation and elongation, respectively. The transcribing enzyme RNA polymerase II may shuttle between these condensates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Molecular principles are being defined that rationalize transcriptional organization and regulation, and that will guide future investigations.},

Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are (i) associated with the lineages in the trajectory, or (ii) differentially expressed between lineages, to illuminate the underlying biological processes. Current data analysis procedures, however, either fail to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference, or fail to pinpoint the exact types of differential expression. We introduce tradeSeq, a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of both within-lineage and between-lineage differential expression. By incorporating observation-level weights, the model additionally allows to account for zero inflation. We evaluate the method on simulated datasets and on real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that it yields biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data.},

Guided by protein dimerization properties, we examined DNA binding specificities of 270 human bZIP pairs. DNA interactomes of 80 heterodimers and 22 homodimers revealed that 72\% of heterodimer motifs correspond to conjoined half-sites preferred by partnering monomers. Remarkably, the remaining motifs are composed of variably-spaced half-sites (12\%) or ‘emergent’ sites (16\%) that cannot be readily inferred from half-site preferences of partnering monomers. These binding sites were biochemically validated by EMSA-FRET analysis and validated in vivo by ChIP-seq data from human cell lines. Focusing on ATF3, we observed distinct cognate site preferences conferred by different bZIP partners, and demonstrated that genome-wide binding of ATF3 is best explained by considering many dimers in which it participates. Importantly, our compendium of bZIP-DNA interactomes predicted bZIP binding to 156 disease associated SNPs, of which only 20 were previously annotated with known bZIP motifs.},

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users’ typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

By using variants detected in scRNA-seq reads, it is possible to assign cells to their donor of origin and identify cross-genotype doublets that may have highly similar transcriptional profiles, precluding detection by transcriptional profile. More subtle cross-genotype variant contamination can be used to estimate the amount of ambient RNA. Ambient RNA is caused by cell lysis before droplet partitioning and is an important confounder of scRNA-seq analysis. Here we develop souporcell, a method to cluster cells using the genetic variants detected within the scRNA-seq reads. We show that it achieves high accuracy on genotype clustering, doublet detection and ambient RNA estimation, as demonstrated across a range of challenging scenarios.},

Understanding the GRN as a system can therefore help identify novel mechanisms underlying disease, which can lead to new therapies. To deduce regulatory interactions relevant to cancer, we applied a recent computational inference framework to data from perturbation experiments in squamous carcinoma cell line A431. GRNs were inferred using several methods, and the false discovery rate was controlled by the NestBoot framework. We developed a novel approach to assess the predictiveness of inferred GRNs against validation data, despite the lack of a gold standard. The best GRN was significantly more predictive than the null model, both in cross-validated benchmarks and for an independent dataset of the same genes under a different perturbation design. The inferred GRN captures many known regulatory interactions central to cancer-relevant processes in addition to predicting many novel interactions, some of which were experimentally validated, thus providing mechanistic insights that are useful for future cancer research.},

	abstract = {The Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) is often found at genomic binding sites adjacent to CTCF, a protein which affects large-scale genome organization through its interaction with cohesin. We show here that, like CTCF, MAZ physically interacts with a cohesin subunit and can arrest cohesin sliding independently of CTCF. It also shares with CTCF the ability to independently pause the elongating form of RNA polymerase II, and consequently affects RNA alternative splicing. CTCF/MAZ double sites are more effective at sequestering cohesin than sites occupied only by CTCF. Furthermore, depletion of CTCF results in preferential loss of CTCF from sites not occupied by MAZ. In an assay for insulation activity like that used for CTCF, binding of MAZ to sites between an enhancer and promoter results in down-regulation of reporter gene expression, supporting a role for MAZ as an insulator protein. Hi-C analysis of the effect of MAZ depletion on genome organization shows that local interactions within topologically associated domains (TADs) are disrupted, as well as contacts that establish the boundaries of individual TADs. We conclude that MAZ augments the action of CTCF in organizing the genome, but also shares properties with CTCF that allow it to act independently.},

Although it is not entirely clear how enhancer-promoter interactions can increase gene expression, this proximity has been observed in multiple systems at multiple loci and is thought to be essential for the maintenance of gene expression. The formation of phase condensates is thought to be an essential component of enhancer function. Here, we show that pharmacological targeting of cells with inhibitors of BET (Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain) proteins can have a strong impact on transcription but very little impact on enhancer-promoter interactions. Treatment with 1,6-hexanediol, which dissolves phase condensate structures and reduces BET and Mediator protein binding at enhancers, can also have a strong effect on gene transcription, without disrupting enhancer-promoter interactions. These results suggest that activation of transcription and maintenance of enhancer-promoter interactions are separable events.

Eomes regulates the accessibility of enhancers that the transcription factor stem cell leukaemia (SCL) normally utilizes to specify primitive erythrocytes and is essential for the normal development of Runx1+ haemogenic endothelium. Single-cell RNA sequencing suggests that Eomes loss of function profoundly blocks the formation of blood progenitors but not specification of Flk-1+ haematoendothelial progenitors. Our findings place Eomes at the top of the transcriptional hierarchy regulating early blood formation and suggest that haemogenic competence is endowed earlier during embryonic development than was previously appreciated.},

In vitro studies have suggested that there are in the dorsal aorta a population of intermediate progenitors that can give rise to both endothelial (or blood vessel lineage) and blood cells. In this issue, two groups present images showing the birth of HSCs from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta in live zebrafish embryos. Bertrand et al. combined fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry to identify and isolate the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs. They also show that the HSCs generated from this haemogenic endothelium are the lineal founders of virtually all of the adult haematopoietic system. Karima Kissa and Philippe Herbomel similarly use imaging of live zebrafish to show HSCs emerge directly from the aorta floor, They show this process that does not involve cell division but movement of single endothelial cells out of the aorta ventral wall into the sub-aortic space, where they transform into haematopoietic cells. They call this new type of cell behaviour endothelial haematopoietic transition (EHT). In a third report, Boisset et al. confirm that this process also occurs in mice, using a dissection procedure to visualize the deeply located aorta.

This study shows that IRF-4 regulates divergent B cell fates via a ‘kinetic-control' mechanism that determines the duration of a transient developmental state., 
          
            
              The intensity of signaling through the B cell receptor controls the level of expression of IRF-4, a transcription factor required for B cell differentiation. The rate of IRF-4 production dictates the extent of antibody gene diversification that B cells undergo upon antigen encounter before differentiating into antibody-secreting plasma cells.
            
            
              Computational modeling and experimental analyses substantiate a model, whereby IRF-4 regulates B cell fate trajectories via a ‘kinetic-control' mechanism.
            
            
              Kinetic control is a process by which B cells pass through an obligate state of variable duration that sets the degree of cellular diversification prior to their terminal differentiation.
            
            
              An incoherent regulatory network architecture, within which IRF-4 is embedded, is the basis for realization of kinetic control.
            
          
        , The generation of a diverse set of pathogen-specific antibodies, with differing affinities and effector functions, by B lymphocytes is essential for efficient protection from many microorganisms. Antibody gene diversification in B cells is mediated by two molecular processes termed class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation (CSR/SHM) (F1A). The former enables the generation of antibodies with the same antigen-binding specificity, but different effector domains, whereas the latter results in a repertoire of antibodies with a range of affinities for a given antigen containing the same effector domain. CSR/SHM occurs in antigen-activated B cells before their terminal differentiation into plasma cells. The transcription factor IRF-4 is required for CSR/SHM as well as plasma-cell differentiation, with its highest levels of expression being necessary for the latter. IRF-4 acts in the context of a network of regulators that include Blimp-1, Pax5, Bach2 and Bcl-6 (F1B). Despite extensive characterization of these individual factors, how the network responds to sensing of antigen by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR, antibody molecule expressed on cell surface) to regulate the extent of antibody gene diversification and plasma-cell differentiation remains to be addressed., To address this issue, we assemble a computational model. The model reveals two contrasting scenarios that can underlie B cell fate dynamics. In one case, the initial rate of IRF-4 production controls a binary cell fate choice that involves either going to the CSR/SHM state or to the plasma-cell state; the time spent in the CSR state is relatively insensitive to the initial rate of IRF-4 production (herein called ‘basic bistability'). In the other case, IRF-4 drives all cells through a transient CSR/SHM state, but the initial rate of IRF-4 production sets its duration (‘kinetic control'). Both scenarios predict that increasing the initial rate of IRF-4 production favors the generation of plasma cells at the expense of CSR/SHM, but they differ fundamentally with respect to the underlying gene expression patterns., To distinguish between these two scenarios experimentally, we utilize two different genetic models. The first involves the B1-8i transgenic mouse whose B cells express a rearranged V187.2 VDJ Ig heavy chain gene segment that is specific for the hapten nitrophenol (NP). The second is a newly developed mouse model that allows exogenous control of IRF-4 expression in naive primary B cells using a tet-inducible allele. Using these models, we show that (i) BCR signal strength sets the initial rate of IRF-4 accumulation and (ii) the concentration of IRF-4 is sensed by an incoherent gene regulatory network architecture to regulate the extent of CSR/SHM prior to plasma-cell differentiation. Our results are consistent with the ‘kinetic-control model' in which the levels of BCR-induced IRF-4 expression control the duration of an obligate CSR/SHM state that enables B cell diversification before terminal differentiation into plasma cells. Evidence for the transient CSR/SHM state is corroborated by both patterns of gene expression and the presence of AID-dependent mutations in individual non-switched plasmablasts., Our results provide a molecular framework for understanding how B cells balance the competing demands for Ig CSR and SHM with the secretion of antibodies during humoral immune responses. The key feature of the network architecture that allows IRF-4 to coordinate the two competing states of gene expression in a temporal manner is that it simultaneously but asymmetrically activates both sides of a bistable mutual repression circuit. Because the two effects of the primary regulator antagonize each other, we describe the circuit as being based on an ‘incoherent' regulatory motif. Other incoherent regulatory motifs in varied biological systems are also associated with the acquisition of transient cell states, and we consider how the kinetic-control mechanism proposed by us could more generally serve to translate developmental cues into elaborate morphogenetic patterns., The B-lymphocyte lineage is a leading system for analyzing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that orchestrate distinct cell fate transitions. Upon antigen recognition, B cells can diversify their immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire via somatic hypermutation (SHM) and/or class switch DNA recombination (CSR) before differentiating into antibody-secreting plasma cells. We construct a mathematical model for a GRN underlying this developmental dynamic. The intensity of signaling through the Ig receptor is shown to control the bimodal expression of a pivotal transcription factor, IRF-4, which dictates B cell fate outcomes. Computational modeling coupled with experimental analysis supports a model of ‘kinetic control', in which B cell developmental trajectories pass through an obligate transient state of variable duration that promotes diversification of the antibody repertoire by SHM/CSR in direct response to antigens. More generally, this network motif could be used to translate a morphogen gradient into developmental inductive events of varying time, thereby enabling the specification of distinct cell fates.},

These efforts led to a model in which extrinsic signals and intrinsic cues establish a permissive chromatin context upon which a regulatory network of transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers act to guide the differentiation of hematopoietic lineages. These networks include lineage-specific factors that further modify the epigenetic landscape and promote the generation of specific cell types. The process of B lymphopoiesis requires a set of transcription factors, including Ikaros, PU.1, E2A, and FoxO1 to ‘prime’ cis-regulatory regions for subsequent activation by the B-lineage-specific transcription factors EBF1 and Pax-5. The expression of EBF1 is initiated by the combined action of E2A and FoxO1, and it is further enhanced and maintained by several positive feedback loops that include Pax-5 and IL-7 signaling. EBF1 acts in concert with Ikaros, PU.1, Runx1, E2A, FoxO1, and Pax-5 to establish the B cell-specific transcription profile. EBF1 and Pax-5 also collaborate to repress alternative cell fates and lock cells into the B-lineage fate. In addition to the functions of EBF1 in establishing and maintaining B-cell identity, EBF1 is required to coordinate differentiation with cell proliferation and survival.},

Unique to vertebrate embryos, it has served as an excellent model system for the study of cell behavior and identity owing to its multipotency, motility and ability to form a broad array of cell types. Neural crest development is thought to be controlled by a suite of transcriptional and epigenetic inputs arranged hierarchically in a gene regulatory network. Here, we examine neural crest development from a gene regulatory perspective and discuss how the underlying genetic circuitry results in the features that define this unique cell population.},

Preassembly of the coactivator complex accelerates the rate of transcription in a cell-free system depleted of TFIID and mediator. Our data argue that this coactivator complex is an intermediate in the assembly of an active transcription complex. Furthermore, the reciprocity of the interactions demonstrates that the complex could in principle be nucleated with either TFIID or mediator, implying that alternative pathways could be utilized to generate diversity in the way activators function in vivo.},

The 289 amino acid protein contains both regions and appears to function primarily as a transcriptional activator. The 243 amino acid protein lacks the transcriptional activation domain and appears to function primarily as a transcriptional repressor. Mutations within a highly conserved region define a novel class of transformation-defective mutants.

However, certain deletions containing the entire DNA binding region are unable to activate transcription and instead act as repressors in vivo. The activation function appears to critically involve just 19 amino acids that are centrally located in an acidic region of GCN4.

One lambda gt11 recombinant expressed a beta-galactosidase-octamer-binding fusion protein with a DNA-binding specificity indistinguishable from human HeLa cell Oct-1 protein. As expected for a ubiquitously expressed protein, Oct-1 mRNA is expressed in all five human and two mouse cell lines tested. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the beta-galactosidase fusion protein shows that the DNA-binding domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins are related antigenically. Deletion analysis of the 743-amino-acid-long oct-1 open reading frame shows that the DNA-binding activity lies within a central highly charged domain of 160 amino acids. Comparison of the Oct-1 and Oct-2 sequences reveals that this domain is nearly identical between the two proteins. Highly similar domains are also present in the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 and the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-86 cell lineage gene product (see Herr et al. 1988). Within this shared POU (Pit-1, Oct-1 and Oct-2, unc-86) domain (pronounced 'pow') lie two subdomains: a POU-related homeo box and a POU-specific box. The Oct-1 protein is unique among the POU-related proteins and other homeo box proteins because it is expressed ubiquitously.},

Such sequence motifs have been identified in nucleic acid binding proteins from a wide range of organisms. Steroid receptor protein fingers are proposed to bind zinc through two pairs of conserved cysteine residues. We report here that a protein of relative molecular mass 19,000 (Mr = 19 K) encompassing the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor that has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity reversibly ligates two Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions.

Such inactive X-specific methylation occurs in a significantly smaller proportion of the cells in the extra-embryonic tissues, yolk sac mesoderm and endoderm, than in the fetus.

We and others used rodent-human hybrid cell lines which had an hprt+ allele on the inactive human X chromosome alone. DNA from all of these cells failed to transform HPRT- recipients. Recently, Chapman et al. have shown that inactive X-chromosome DNA from several tissues of adult female mice is strikingly inefficient in genetic transformation for the hprt gene. On the other hand, de Jonge et al., using simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed fibroblasts from a human heterozygous for an HPRT deficiency, observed HPRT transformation regardless of whether the hprt+ allele was on the active or the inactive X chromosome of the donor cells. We have done an experiment similar to that of deJonge et al., and report here results which clearly indicate that DNA from the inactive X chromosome functions very poorly in HPRT transformation, thus supporting the original interpretation of Liskay and Evans that inactive X-chromosomal DNA is structurally modified.},

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis shows that the presence of DNA methylation brings about the deacetylation of histone H4 and methylation of Lys9 of histone H3 (H3 Lys9) and prevents methylation of Lys4 of histone H3 (H3 Lys4), thus generating a structure identical to that of methylated sequences in the genome.

N-1.0 kb is active in all cell types tested. The other silencer (N-0.25 kb) at position -0.25 kb shows reduced activity in primary macrophages. Despite their different specificities, the activity of both silencer elements can be influenced similarly. An inverse linear relationship between the transcriptional activity of the tested constructs and the potential inhibition by the silencer elements was found: weak transcription units can be strongly repressed, whereas strong transcription units can be only weakly repressed.

This region comprises 200-250 bp of DNA, and is situated within the large intron of the gene, approximately 600 bp upstream from the constant region coding sequence. The local chromatin structure of this region correlates with tissue-specific kappa gene expression: it is resistant to nucleolytic digestion in the inactive kappa genes of murine brain and liver nuclei, but becomes uniquely sensitive to cleavage by deoxyribonuclease I or by a variety of restriction endonucleases in the chromatin of kappa-producing cells. Nuclease sensitivity at this site occurs in both rearranged and unrearranged kappa alleles, and can be maintained in the absence of ongoing kappa transcription. The nucleotide sequence of the hypersensitive region has been selectively conserved in evolution, and includes both a 7 bp inverted repeat sequence and a short segment homologous to the transcriptional enhancer elements of certain eukaryotic viruses.

Factor binding invariably potentiates chromatin accessibility. Cell-selective glucocorticoid receptor occupancy patterns appear to be comprehensively predetermined by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns, with secondary contributions from local sequence features.

About half of cellular P-TEFb also exists in an inactive complex with the 7SK snRNA and the HEXIM1 protein. Here, we show that the remaining half associates with the bromodomain protein Brd4. In stress-induced cells, the 7SK/HEXIM1-bound P-TEFb is quantitatively converted into the Brd4-associated form. The association with Brd4 is necessary to form the transcriptionally active P-TEFb, recruits P-TEFb to a promoter, and enables P-TEFb to contact the Mediator complex, a potential target for the Brd4-mediated recruitment. Although generally required for transcription, the P-TEFb-recruitment function of Brd4 can be substituted by that of HIV-1 Tat, which recruits P-TEFb directly for activated HIV-1 transcription. Brd4, HEXIM1, and 7SK are all implicated in regulating cell growth, which may result from their dynamic control of the general transcription factor P-TEFb.},

Despite the wide occurrence of these bromodomains, their three-dimensional structure and binding partners remain unknown. Here we report the solution structure of the bromodomain of the HAT co-activator P/CAF (p300/CBP-associated factor). The structure reveals an unusual left-handed up-and-down four-helix bundle. In addition, we show by a combination of structural and site-directed mutagenesis studies that bromodomains can interact specifically with acetylated lysine, making them the first known protein modules to do so. The nature of the recognition of acetyl-lysine by the P/CAF bromodomain is similar to that of acetyl-CoA by histone acetyltransferase. Thus, the bromodomain is functionally linked to the HAT activity of co-activators in the regulation of gene transcription.},

Using bioluminescent imaging, we now demonstrate that H9 line hESC-derived NK cells mediate effective clearance of human tumor cells in vivo. In addition to increased in vitro killing of diverse tumor targets, the in vivo tumor clearance by H9 hESC-derived NK cells was more effective compared with NK cells derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB). Phenotypic analysis demonstrates the hESC-derived NK cells are uniformly CD94+CD117(low/-), an NK-cell population characterized by potent cytolytic activity and thus more competent to mediate tumor clearance.

In this study, we report that it is feasible to generate functional megakaryocytes and platelets from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) on a large scale. Differential-interference contrast and electron microscopy analyses showed that ultrastructural and morphological features of hESC-derived platelets were indistinguishable from those of normal blood platelets. In functional assays, hESC-derived platelets responded to thrombin stimulation, formed microaggregates, and facilitated clot formation/retraction in vitro. Live cell microscopy demonstrated that hESC-platelets formed lamellipodia and filopodia in response to thrombin activation, and tethered to each other as observed in normal blood. Using real-time intravital imaging with high-speed video microscopy, we have also shown that hESC-derived platelets contribute to developing thrombi at sites of laser-induced vascular injury in mice, providing the first evidence for in vivo functionality of hESC-derived platelets. These results represent an important step toward generating an unlimited supply of platelets for transfusion. Since platelets contain no genetic material, they are ideal candidates for early clinical translation involving human pluripotent stem cells.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This historical perspective reviews how work of Eric H. Davidson was a catalyst and exemplar for explaining haematopoietic cell fate determination through gene regulation.
RECENT FINDINGS: Researchers studying blood and immune cells pioneered many of the early mechanistic investigations of mammalian gene regulatory processes. These efforts included the characterization of complex gene regulatory sequences exemplified by the globin and T-cell/B-cell receptor gene loci, as well as the identification of many key regulatory transcription factors through the fine mapping of chromosome translocation breakpoints in leukaemia patients. As the repertoire of known regulators expanded, assembly into gene regulatory network models became increasingly important, not only to account for the truism that regulatory genes do not function in isolation but also to devise new ways of extracting biologically meaningful insights from even more complex information. Here we explore how Eric H. Davidson's pioneering studies of gene regulatory network control in nonvertebrate model organisms have had an important and lasting impact on research into blood and immune cell development.
SUMMARY: The intellectual framework developed by Davidson continues to contribute to haematopoietic research, and his insistence on demonstrating logic and causality still challenges the frontier of research today.},

Transcriptional profiling revealed that multiple stem cell maintenance factors are perturbed in Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs, which prematurely express a large subset of genes, including cell-cycle regulators, normally expressed in non-self-renewing multipotent progenitors. A significant proportion of Pbx1-dependent genes is associated with the TGF-beta pathway, which serves a major role in maintaining HSC quiescence. Prospectively isolated, Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs display altered transcriptional responses to TGF-beta stimulation in vitro, suggesting a possible mechanism through which Pbx1 maintenance of stem cell quiescence may in part be achieved.},

Here, we questioned whether other YS lineages exist that have not been identified, partially owing to limitations of current lineage tracing models. We established the use of Cdh5-CreERT2 for hematopoietic fate mapping, which revealed the YS origin of mast cells (MCs). YS-derived MCs were replaced by definitive MCs, which maintained themselves independently from the bone marrow in the adult. Replacement occurred with tissue-specific kinetics. MCs in the embryonic skin, but not other organs, remained largely YS derived prenatally and were phenotypically and transcriptomically distinct from definite adult MCs.

For example, which specific embryonic tissues participate in B lymphopoiesis and whether hematopoietic differentiation is skewed toward specific B-cell subsets in the embryo are unanswered questions, because the systemic circulation is initiated early during embryogenesis, resulting in an admixture of cells potentially originating from multiple sites. We demonstrate, using Ncx1(-/-) mice that lack systemic blood circulation, that the E9 yolk sac (YS) and the intra-embryonic para-aortic splanchnopleura (P-Sp) tissues independently give rise to AA4.1(+)CD19(+)B220(lo-neg) B progenitor cells that preferentially differentiate into innate type B-1 and marginal zone (MZ) B cells but not into B-2 cells upon transplantation. We have further demonstrated that these B-1 progenitor cells arise directly from YS and P-Sp hemogenic endothelium. These results document the initial wave of innate B lymphopoietic progenitor cells available for seeding the fetal liver at E11.

However, the critical downstream targets of Scl remain undefined. Here, we identified a novel Scl target gene, transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (Mef2C) from Sclfl/fl fetal liver progenitor cell lines. Analysis of Mef2C−/− embryos showed that Mef2C, in contrast to Scl, is not essential for specification into primitive or definitive hematopoietic lineages. However, adult VavCre+Mef2Cfl/fl mice exhibited platelet defects similar to those observed in Scl-deficient mice. The platelet counts were reduced, whereas platelet size was increased and the platelet shape and granularity were altered. Furthermore, megakaryopoiesis was severely impaired in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray hybridization analysis revealed that Mef2C is directly regulated by Scl in megakaryocytic cells, but not in erythroid cells. In addition, an Scl-independent requirement for Mef2C in B-lymphoid homeostasis was observed in Mef2C-deficient mice, characterized as severe age-dependent reduction of specific B-cell progenitor populations reminiscent of premature aging. In summary, this work identifies Mef2C as an integral member of hematopoietic transcription factors with distinct upstream regulatory mechanisms and functional requirements in megakaryocyte and B-lymphoid lineages.},

In addition, Meis1-deficient embryos lack well-formed capillaries, although larger blood vessels are normal. Definitive myeloerythroid lineages are present in the mutant embryos, but the total numbers of colony-forming cells are dramatically reduced.

The signaling pathways mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) are required for these processes. Here we show that a proto-oncogene, meis1, plays important roles in the vascular development in zebrafish. Knockdown of meis1 by anti-sense meis1 morpholino (meis1 MO) led to the impairment of intersegmental vessel (ISV) formation. In meis1 morphants, the expression of an artery marker was reduced in dorsal aorta (DA), and the expression of vein markers was expanded in DA and posterior cardinal vein (PCV), suggesting the defects on artery development. Furthermore, the expression of vegf receptor, flk1, was significantly decreased in these embryos. Interestingly, flk1 MO-injected embryos exhibited similar defects as meis1 morphants. Thus, these results implicate that meis1 is a novel regulator involved in endothelial cell development, presumably affecting the vegf signaling pathway.},

The transcription factors Runx1 and GATA3 have been implicated in this Spi1 repression, but the basis of the timing was unknown. We show that increasing Runx1 and/or GATA3 down-regulates Spi1 expression in pro–T cells, while deletion of these factors after Spi1 down-regulation reactivates its expression. Leveraging the stage specificities of repression and transcription factor binding revealed an unconventional but functional site in Spi1 intron 2. Acute Cas9-mediated deletion or disruption of the Runx and GATA motifs in this element reactivates silenced Spi1 expression in a pro–T cell line, substantially more than disruption of other candidate elements, and counteracts the repression of Spi1 in primary pro–T cells during commitment. Thus, Runx1 and GATA3 work stage specifically through an intronic silencing element in mouse Spi1 to control strength and maintenance of Spi1 repression during T lineage commitment.},

	abstract = {Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) can act as both an activator and a repressor. Here we show that CRISPR-mediated deletion of Runx1 in mouse metanephric mesenchyme-derived mK4 cells results in large-scale genome-wide changes to chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Open chromatin regions near down-regulated loci enriched for Runx sites in mK4 cells lose chromatin accessibility in Runx1 knockout cells, despite remaining Runx2-bound. Unexpectedly, regions near upregulated genes are depleted of Runx sites and are instead enriched for Zeb transcription factor binding sites. Re-expressing Zeb2 in Runx1 knockout cells restores suppression, and CRISPR mediated deletion of Zeb1 and Zeb2 phenocopies the gained expression and chromatin accessibility changes seen in Runx1KO due in part to subsequent activation of factors like Grhl2. These data confirm that Runx1 activity is uniquely needed to maintain open chromatin at many loci, and demonstrate that Zeb proteins are required and sufficient to maintain Runx1-dependent genome-scale repression., Runt-related transcription factor (Runx) 1 \& 2 impact development and disease by activating or repressing transcription. In this manuscript we used genome editing tools to remove Runx1, and as expected, observed widespread changes in chromatin accessibility. Newly closed areas contained Runx1 binding sites and were enriched near genes whose expression depended on Runx1. Interestingly, this occurred despite continued binding of Runx2 to the same regions of DNA, which suggests that Runx2 is insufficient to maintain open chromatin and expression of Runx1 target genes in this cellular context. By contrast, newly opened chromatin regions, many near genes that were upregulated in Runx1 knockout cells, did not enrich for Runx1 binding sites. Instead, these regions were enriched for sites for the repressor Zeb proteins. We found that the loss of Zeb 1 \& 2 expression, direct transcriptional targets of Runx1, resulted in the opening of chromatin and upregulation of genes residing near the newly open sites in Runx1 knockout cells. The same sites were also open and nearby genes expressed in edited Zeb1 and Zeb2 knockout cells. Among them were transcription factors, such as the Grhl2 gene, which in turn bind to and upregulate their target genes. Thus, the loss of a single transcription factor initiates a cascade of direct and indirect ramifications with likely negative effects on development and health.},

However, the molecular mechanisms determining which endothelial progenitors possess this hemogenic potential are currently unknown. Here, we investigated the changes in hemogenic potential in endothelial progenitors at the early stages of embryonic development. Using an ETV2::GFP reporter mouse to isolate emerging endothelial progenitors, we observed a dramatic decrease in hemogenic potential between embryonic day (E)7.5 and E8.5. At the molecular level, Runx1 is expressed at much lower levels in E8.5 intra-embryonic progenitors, while Bmi1 expression is increased. Remarkably, the ectopic expression of Runx1 in these progenitors fully restores their hemogenic potential, as does the suppression of BMI1 function. Altogether, our data demonstrate that hemogenic competency in recently specified endothelial progenitors is restrained through the active silencing of Runx1 expression.,

All three factors are absolutely required for blood cell generation, each one controlling a precise step of specification from the mesoderm germ layer to fully functional blood progenitors.

Here, we map ETV2 global binding sites and carry out in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells, and germ line and conditional knockout mouse studies to uncover mechanisms involved in the hemangiogenic fate commitment from mesoderm. We show that ETV2 binds to enhancers that specify hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineages. We find that the hemangiogenic progenitor population in the developing embryo can be identified as FLK1(high)PDGFRα(-). Notably, these hemangiogenic progenitors are exclusively sensitive to ETV2-dependent FLK1 signaling. Importantly, ETV2 turns on other Ets genes, thereby establishing an ETS hierarchy. Consequently, the hematopoietic and endothelial cell program initiated by ETV2 is maintained partly by other ETS factors through an ETS switching mechanism. These findings highlight the critical role that transient ETV2 expression plays in the regulation of hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineage specification and stability.},

Although NF-E2 levels correlate with JAK2(V671F) allele burden in some PV cohorts, the molecular mechanism causing aberrant NF-E2 expression has not been described. Here we show that NF-E2 expression is also increased in patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis independent of the presence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Characterization of the NF-E2 promoter revealed multiple functional binding sites for AML1/RUNX-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated AML1 binding to the NF-E2 promoter in vivo. Moreover, AML1 binding to the NF-E2 promoter was significantly increased in granulocytes from PV patients compared with healthy controls. AML1 mRNA expression was elevated in patients with PV, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis both in the presence and absence of JAK2(V617F). In addition, AML1 and NF-E2 expression were highly correlated. RNAi-mediated suppression of either AML1 or of its binding partner CBF-beta significantly decreased NF-E2 expression. Moreover, expression of the leukemic fusion protein AML/ETO drastically decreased NF-E2 protein levels.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating first the priming and then maintenance of gene expression within one developmental pathway are essentially unknown. The hematopoietic system represents a powerful experimental model to address these questions and here we have focused on a regulatory circuit playing a central role in myelopoiesis: the transcription factor PU.1, its target gene colony-stimulating-factor 1 receptor (Csf1r), and key upstream regulators such as RUNX1. We find that during ontogeny, chromatin unfolding precedes the establishment of active histone marks and the formation of stable transcription factor complexes at the Pu.1 locus and we show that chromatin remodeling is mediated by the transient binding of RUNX1 to Pu.1 cis-elements. By contrast, chromatin reorganization of Csf1r requires prior expression of PU.1 together with RUNX1 binding. Once the full hematopoietic program is established, stable transcription factor complexes and active chromatin can be maintained without RUNX1. Our experiments therefore demonstrate how individual transcription factors function in a differentiation stage–specific manner to differentially affect the initiation versus maintenance of a developmental program.},

TGF-beta induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and Smad2 in endothelial cells and these effects can be blocked upon selective inhibition of ALK1 or ALK5 expression, respectively. Whereas the TGF-beta/ALK5 pathway leads to inhibition of cell migration and proliferation, the TGF-beta/ALK1 pathway induces endothelial cell migration and proliferation. We identified genes that are induced specifically by TGF-beta-mediated ALK1 or ALK5 activation. Id1 was found to mediate the TGF-beta/ALK1-induced (and Smad-dependent) migration, while induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by activated ALK5 may contribute to the TGF-beta-induced maturation of blood vessels.

Mice deficient for various TGF-β signaling components present an embryonic lethality due to vascular defects. In patients, mutations in the TGF-β type I receptor ALK1 or in the accessory TGF-β receptor endoglin are linked to an autosomal dominant disorder of vascular dysplasia termed Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). It has puzzled researchers for years to explain the effects of TGF-β being a stimulator and an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Recently, a model has been proposed in which TGF-β by binding to the TGF-β type II receptor can activate two distinct type I receptors in endothelial cells (ECs), i.e., the EC-restricted ALK1 and the broadly expressed ALK-5, which have opposite effects on ECs behavior. ALK1 via Smad1/5 transcription factors stimulates EC proliferation and migration, whereas ALK5 via Smad2/3 inhibits EC proliferation and migration. Here, the new findings are presented concerning the molecular mechanisms that take place in ECs to precisely regulate and even switch between TGF-β-induced biological responses. In particular, the role of the accessory TGF-β receptor endoglin in the regulation of EC behavior is addressed and new insights are discussed concerning the possible mechanisms that are implicated in the development of HHT.},

Additional in vitro studies suggest instead that mesodermal precursors first generate hemogenic endothelium, which then generate blood cells in a linear sequence. We conducted an in vivo clonal analysis to determine the potential of individual cells in the mouse epiblast, primitive streak, and early YS. We found that early YS blood and endothelial lineages mostly derive from independent epiblast populations, specified before gastrulation. Additionally, a subpopulation of the YS endothelium has hemogenic activity and displays characteristics similar to those found later in the embryonic hemogenic endothelium. Our results show that the earliest blood and endothelial cell populations in the mouse embryo are specified independently, and that hemogenic endothelium first appears in the YS and produces blood precursors with markers related to definitive hematopoiesis.},

Here we employ a temporally restricted genetic tracing strategy to selectively label the endothelium, and separately its underlying mesenchyme, during AGM development. Lineage tracing endothelium, via an inducible VE-cadherin Cre line, reveals that the endothelium is capable of HSC emergence. The endothelial progeny migrate to the fetal liver, and later to the bone marrow, and are capable of expansion, self-renewal, and multilineage hematopoietic differentiation. HSC capacity is exclusively endothelial, as ex vivo analyses demonstrate lack of VE-cadherin Cre induction in circulating and fetal liver hematopoietic populations. Moreover, AGM mesenchyme, as selectively traced via a myocardin Cre line, is incapable of hematopoiesis. Our genetic tracing strategy therefore reveals an endothelial origin of HSCs.},

	abstract = {GATA-2 is an essential transcription factor in the hematopoietic system that is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors. Complete deficiency of GATA-2 in the mouse leads to severe anemia and embryonic lethality. The role of GATA-2 and dosage effects of this transcription factor in HSC development within the embryo and adult are largely unexplored. Here we examined the effects of GATA-2 gene dosage on the generation and expansion of HSCs in several hematopoietic sites throughout mouse development. We show that a haploid dose of GATA-2 severely reduces production and expansion of HSCs specifically in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (which autonomously generates the first HSCs), whereas quantitative reduction of HSCs is minimal or unchanged in yolk sac, fetal liver, and adult bone marrow. However, HSCs in all these ontogenically distinct anatomical sites are qualitatively defective in serial or competitive transplantation assays. Also, cytotoxic drug-induced regeneration studies show a clear GATA-2 dose-related proliferation defect in adult bone marrow. Thus, GATA-2 plays at least two functionally distinct roles during ontogeny of HSCs: the production and expansion of HSCs in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros and the proliferation of HSCs in the adult bone marrow.},

The Gata2 transcription factor is essential for HSC generation and function. In contrast to surface-marker-based cell isolation, Gata2-based enrichment provides a direct link to the internal HSC regulatory network. Here, we use iterations of index-sorting of Gata2-expressing intra-aortic hematopoietic cluster (IAHC) cells, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional analyses to connect HSC identity to specific gene expression. Gata2-expressing IAHC cells separate into 5 major transcriptomic clusters. Iterative analyses reveal refined CD31, cKit, and CD27 phenotypic parameters that associate specific molecular profiles in one cluster with distinct HSC and multipotent progenitor function. Thus, by iterations of single-cell approaches, we identify the transcriptome of the first functional HSCs as they emerge in the mouse embryo and localize them to aortic clusters containing 1-2 cells.},

Thus, in principle, GRN models may provide system-level, causal explanations of developmental process. To test this assertion, we have transformed a relatively well-established GRN model into a predictive, dynamic Boolean computational model. This Boolean model computes spatial and temporal gene expression according to the regulatory logic and gene interactions specified in a GRN model for embryonic development in the sea urchin. Additional information input into the model included the progressive embryonic geometry and gene expression kinetics. The resulting model predicted gene expression patterns for a large number of individual regulatory genes each hour up to gastrulation (30 h) in four different spatial domains of the embryo. Direct comparison with experimental observations showed that the model predictively computed these patterns with remarkable spatial and temporal accuracy. In addition, we used this model to carry out in silico perturbations of regulatory functions and of embryonic spatial organization. The model computationally reproduced the altered developmental functions observed experimentally. Two major conclusions are that the starting GRN model contains sufficiently complete regulatory information to permit explanation of a complex developmental process of gene expression solely in terms of genomic regulatory code, and that the Boolean model provides a tool with which to test in silico regulatory circuitry and developmental perturbations.},

We find that reconstitution of TCR alpha enhancer function in nonlymphoid cells requires expression of the lymphoid-specific proteins LEF-1, Ets-1 and PEBP2 alpha (CBF alpha), and a specific arrangement of their binding sites in the enhancer. We show that Ets-1 cooperates with PEBP2 alpha to bind adjacent sites at one end of the enhancer, forming a ternary complex that is unstable by itself. Stable occupancy of the Ets-1- and PEBP2 alpha-binding sites in a DNase I protection assay was found to depend on both a specific helical phasing relationship with a nonadjacent ATF/CREB-binding site at the other end of the enhancer and on LEF-1. The HMG domain of LEF-1 was found previously to bend the DNA helix in the center of the TCR alpha enhancer. We now show that the HMG domain of the distantly related SRY protein, which also bends DNA, can partially replace LEF-1 in stimulating enhancer function in transfection assays. Taken together with the observation that Ets-1 and members of the ATF/CREB family have the potential to associate in vitro, these data suggest that LEF-1 can coordinate the assembly of a specific higher-order enhancer complex by facilitating interactions between proteins bound at nonadjacent sites.},

Here we have reconstituted regulated TCR alpha enhancer activity in vitro on chromatin templates using purified T-cell transcription factors (LEF-1, AML1, and Ets-1) and the cyclic AMP-responsive transcription factor CREB. When added in combination, these factors activate the TCR alpha enhancer in a highly synergistic manner. Alternatively, the enhancer could also be activated in vitro by high levels of either CREB or a complex containing all of the T-cell proteins (LEF-1, AML1, and Ets-1). Phosphorylation of CREB by protein kinase A enhanced transcription 10-fold in vitro, and this effect was abolished by a point mutation affecting the CREB PKA phosphorylation site (Ser-133). Interestingly, LEF-1 strongly enhanced the binding of the AML1/Ets-1 complex on chromatin, but not nonchromatin, templates. A LEF-1 mutant containing only the HMG DNA-binding domain was sufficient to form a higher-order complex with AML1/Ets-1, but exhibited only partial activity in transcription. We conclude that the T cell-enriched proteins assemble on the enhancer independently of CREB and function synergistically with CREB to activate the TCR alpha enhancer in a chromatin environment.},

Instead of bHLH-zip proteins, we found that the human enhancer bound core binding factor (CBF) between the muA and mu elements; CBF binding was shown to be a common feature of both murine and human enhancers. Furthermore, mutant enhancers that bound prototypic bHLH-zip proteins but not CBF did not activate transcription in B cells, and conversely, CBF transactivated the murine enhancer in nonlymphoid cells. Taking these data together with the earlier analysis of T-cell-specific enhancers, we propose that ETS-CBF is a common composite element in the regulation of antigen receptor genes. In addition, these studies identify the first B-cell target of CBF, a protein that has been implicated in the development of childhood pre-B-cell leukemias.},

	abstract = {Auto-inhibition is a common transcriptional control mechanism that is well characterized in the regulatory transcription factor Ets-1. Autoinhibition of Ets-1 DNA binding works through an inhibitory module that exists in two conformations. DNA binding requires a change in the inhibitory module from the packed to disrupted conformation. This structural switch provides a mechanism to tightly regulate Ets-1 DNA binding. We report that the Ets-1 partner protein core-binding factor alpha2 (CBFalpha2; also known as AML1 or PEBP2) stimulates Ets-1 DNA binding and counteracts auto-inhibition. Support for this conclusion came from three observations. First, the level of cooperative DNA binding (10-fold) was similar to the level of repression by auto-inhibition (10- to 20-fold). Next, a region necessary for cooperative DNA binding mapped to the inhibitory module. Third, an Ets-1 mutant with a constitutively disrupted inhibitory module did not bind DNA cooperatively with CBFalpha2. Furthermore, two additional lines of evidence indicated that CBFalpha2 affects the structural switch by direct interactions with Ets-1. First, the retention of cooperative DNA binding on nicked duplexes eliminated a potential role of through-DNA effects. Second, cooperative DNA binding was observed on composite sites with altered spacing or reversed orientation. We suggest that only protein interactions can accommodate this observed flexibility. These findings provide a mechanism by which CBF relieves the auto-inhibition of Ets-1 and illustrates one strategy for the synergistic activity of regulatory transcription factors.},

The two processes can be uncoupled, since, in PU.1-deficient pre-B cells, C/EBPs induce CD19 downregulation but not Mac-1 activation.

	abstract = {Polyomavirus enhancer binding protein, PEBP2 (PEA2), is a heterodimer of two distinct subunits, alpha and beta, of which the former directly binds to DNA and the latter acts auxiliary to enhance the DNA binding. Recent cloning studies has revealed that the alpha subunit is homologous to the products of the Drosophila segmentation gene runt and the human AML1 gene, and that it functions as a major regulator for the T cell-specific gene expression. We have currently cloned cDNAs for the beta subunit. The isolated cDNAs contain three isoforms that are presumed to arise from alternative RNA splicing and encode polypeptides consisting of 187, 182, and 155 amino acids, respectively. These polypeptides neither show any significant homology with known other proteins including the alpha subunit nor have any known DNA-binding and dimerization domains. Thus, PEBP2, as the complex of these subunits, is thought to constitute an entirely novel category of heteromeric transcriptional regulator together with the Runt and AML1 proteins. Gel retardation assays of the cDNA-encoded proteins produced in an in vitro translation system or in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the larger two beta isoforms, but not the smallest one, can dimerize with the alpha subunit. Furthermore, this heterodimerization was shown to cause a marked increase in the intrinsic DNA binding affinity of the alpha subunit.},

CBFbeta associates with DNA-binding CBFalpha subunits and increases their affinity for DNA. Genes encoding the CBFbeta subunit (CBFB) and one of the CBFalpha subunits (CBFA2, otherwise known as AML1) are the most frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias in humans. We and others previously demonstrated that homozygous disruption of the mouse Cbfa2 (AML1) gene results in embryonic lethality at midgestation due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system and blocks fetal liver hematopoiesis. Here we demonstrate that homozygous mutation of the Cbfb gene results in the same phenotype. Our results demonstrate that the CBFbeta subunit is required for CBFalpha2 function in vivo.},

	abstract = {We have studied the transient expression of a cloned rabbit hemoglobin beta 1 gene after its introduction into HeLa cells. Two and one-half days after transfection using the calcium phosphate technique we extracted RNA from the entire cell population and analyzed it by the S1 nuclease hybridization assay. Transcripts were barely detectable when beta-globin gene-plasmid recombinants were used. However, 200 times more beta-globin gene transcripts were found when the beta-globin gene recombinants also contained SV40 DNA, and 90\% of these transcripts (about 1000 per cell) had the same 5' end as authentic rabbit globin mRNA. In the latter case, abundant production of beta-globin protein was readily detected in a fraction of transfected cells by immunofluorescent staining. Enhancement of globin gene expression was dependent on SV40 sequences acting in cis, but independent of the viral origin of DNA replication. The enhancing activity was associated with the 72 bp repeated sequence element located at the beginning of the viral late gene region. Viral DNA fragments containing the transcriptional enhancer element could act in either orientation at many positions, including 1400 bp upstream or 3300 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site of the rabbit beta-globin gene. These studies define a class of DNA elements with a mode of action that has not been heretofore described. The activation of genes by specific enhancer elements seems to be a widespread mechanism that may be used for the regulation of gene expression.},

One of these sites, a “silencer,” exhibits enhancer-like distance- and orientation-independence. The silencer demonstrates both autonomous replication sequence (ARS) activity and a centromere-like segregation function, suggesting roles for DNA replication and segregation in transcriptional repression. Here we identify three sequences (A, E, and B) involved both in repression and in either ARS or segregation activity. The sequences are functionally redundant: no one is essential for complete transcriptional control, but mutations in any two inactivate the silencer. Surprisingly, elements E and B can each activate transcription from heterologous promoters, and E shows striking homology to several yeast upstream activation sequences. Therefore, sequences individually involved in replication, segregation, and transcriptional activation can, at the silencer, efficiently repress transcription.},

We demonstrate that one of these cis-acting sequences, HMRE, is able to switch off at least two nonmating-type promoters. In common with enhancers, it is able to function in either orientation, relatively independently of its position with respect to the regulated promoter, and can act on promoters 2600 bp away.

The dTAG system pairs a novel degrader of FKBP12F36V with expression of FKBP12F36V in-frame with a protein of interest. By transgene expression or CRISPR-mediated locus-specific knock-in, we exemplify a generalizable strategy to study the immediate consequence of protein loss.

	abstract = {Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression of individual cells provides an opportunity to decipher enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (eGRN). Here we present a new method for the inference of eGRNs, called SCENIC+. SCENIC+ predicts genomic enhancers along with candidate upstream transcription factors (TF) and links these enhancers to candidate target genes. Specific TFs for each cell type or cell state are predicted based on the concordance of TF binding site accessibility, TF expression, and target gene expression. To improve both recall and precision of TF identification, we curated and clustered more than 40,000 position weight matrices that we could associate with 1,553 human TFs. We validated and benchmarked each of the SCENIC+ components on diverse data sets from different species, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cell types, ENCODE cell lines, human melanoma cell states, and Drosophila retinal development. Next, we exploit SCENIC+ predictions to study conserved TFs, enhancers, and GRNs between human and mouse cell types in the cerebral cortex. Finally, we provide new capabilities that exploit the inferred eGRNs to study the dynamics of gene regulation along differentiation trajectories; to map regulatory activities onto tissues using spatial omics data; and to predict the effect of TF perturbations on cell state. SCENIC+ provides critical insight into gene regulation, starting from multiome atlases of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq. The SCENIC+ suite is available as a set of Python modules at https://scenicplus.readthedocs.io.},

In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

The spreading power of all network nodes is better explained by considering, from a continuous-time epidemiological perspective, the distribution of the force of infection each node generates. The resulting metric, the expected force, accurately quantifies node spreading power under all primary epidemiological models across a wide range of archetypical human contact networks. When node power is low, influence is a function of neighbor degree. As power increases, a node's own degree becomes more important. The strength of this relationship is modulated by network structure, being more pronounced in narrow, dense networks typical of social networking and weakening in broader, looser association networks such as the Internet. The expected force can be computed independently for individual nodes, making it applicable for networks whose adjacency matrix is dynamic, not well specified, or overwhelmingly large.},

Recruitment of PRC1 to target sites has been proposed to occur through a hierarchical process, dependent on prior nucleation of PRC2 and placement of H3K27me3. Here, using a de novo targeting assay in mouse embryonic stem cells we unexpectedly discover that PRC1-dependent H2AK119ub1 leads to recruitment of PRC2 and H3K27me3 to effectively initiate a polycomb domain. This activity is restricted to variant PRC1 complexes, and genetic ablation experiments reveal that targeting of the variant PCGF1/PRC1 complex by KDM2B to CpG islands is required for normal polycomb domain formation and mouse development. These observations provide a surprising PRC1-dependent logic for PRC2 occupancy at target sites in vivo.},

Many lines of evidence have shown that RUNX1 plays a critical role in regulating the development and precise maintenance of mammalian hematopoiesis. Studies using knockout mice have shown the importance of RUNX1 in a wide variety of hematopoietic cells, including hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes. Recently, target molecular processes of RUNX1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis have been revealed. Although RUNX1 is not required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, it is required for the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells due to RUNX1 deletion may be an important cause of human leukemias. Molecular abnormalities cooperating with loss of RUNX1 have also been identified.

	abstract = {MYB is a transcription factor which was identified in birds as a viral oncogene (v-MYB). Its cellular counterpart was subsequently isolated as c-MYB which has three functional domains - DNA binding domain, transactivation domain and negative regulatory domain. c-MYB is essential for survival, and deletion of both alleles of the gene results in embryonic death. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, thymus and neural tissue, and required for T and B lymphocyte development and erythroid maturation. Additionally, aberrant MYB expression has been found in numerous solid cancer cells and human leukemia. Recent studies have also implicated c-MYB in the regulation of expression of fetal hemoglobin which is highly beneficial to the β-hemoglobinopathies (beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease). These findings suggest that MYB could be a potential therapeutic target in leukemia, and possibly also a target for therapeutic increase of fetal hemoglobin in the β-hemoglobinopathies.},

The c-myc proto-oncogene, usually implicated in cell transformation, differentiation and cell-cycle progression also has a central role in some forms of apoptosis. These opposing roles of myc in cell growth and death require that other gene products dictate the outcome of c-Myc expression on a cell. A candidate for such a modifying gene is bcl-2, whose product prolongs cell survival and blocks apoptosis in some systems. Here we demonstrate that Bcl-2 prevents apoptotic death induced by c-Myc, provide a mechanism whereby cells can express c-Myc without undergoing apoptosis, and give a possible explanation for the ability of Bcl-2 to synergize with c-Myc in cell transformation.},

LEDGF is required for both MLL-dependent transcription and leukemic transformation. Conversely, a subset of menin mutations in MEN1 patients abrogates interaction with LEDGF while preserving MLL interaction, but nevertheless compromises MLL/menin-dependent functions.

MLL1 fusion proteins lack the PHD fingers and require prebinding of a wild-type MLL1 complex and CXXC domain recognition of DNA for stable HoxA9 association. Together, these results suggest that specific recruitment of MLL1 requires multiple interactions and is a precondition for stable recruitment of MLL1 fusion proteins to HoxA9 in leukemogenesis.

In RS4:11 cells, combining G3139 with doxorubicin (ADR) increased active caspase 3 and TUNEL staining compared to ADR alone, indicating greater apoptosis, and G3139 increased S-phase progression. The abundant BCL-2 affords a molecular target in leukaemias with t(4;11).

However, there is little in vivo evidence supporting the binding of bromodomains to acetylated chromatin in the native environment. Brd4 is a member of the BET family that carries two bromodomains. It associates with mitotic chromosomes, a feature characteristic of the family. Here, we studied the interaction of Brd4 with chromatin in living cells by photobleaching. Brd4 was mobile and interacted with chromatin with a rapid "on and off" mode of binding. This interaction required both bromodomains. Indicating a preferential interaction with acetylated chromatin, Brd4 became less mobile upon increased chromatin acetylation caused by a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Providing biochemical support, salt solubility of Brd4 was markedly reduced upon increased histone acetylation. This change also required both bromodomains. In peptide binding assays, Brd4 avidly bound to di- and tetraacetylated histone H4 and diacetylated H3, but weakly or not at all to mono- and unacetylated H3 and H4. By contrast, it did not bind to unacetylated H4 or H3. Further, Brd4 colocalized with acetylated H4 and H3 in noncentromeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. This colocalization also required both bromodomains. These observations indicate that Brd4 specifically recognizes acetylated histone codes, and this recognition is passed onto the chromatin of newly divided cells.},

However, the normal function of DOT1L in mammalian gene regulation is poorly understood. Here we report that DOT1L recruitment is ubiquitously coupled with active transcription in diverse mammalian cell types. DOT1L preferentially occupies the proximal transcribed region of active genes, correlating with enrichment of H3K79 di- and trimethylation. Furthermore, Dot1l mutant fibroblasts lacked H3K79 di- and trimethylation at all sites examined, indicating that DOT1L is the sole enzyme responsible for these marks. Importantly, we identified chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay conditions necessary for reliable H3K79 methylation detection. ChIP-chip tiling arrays revealed that levels of all degrees of genic H3K79 methylation correlate with mRNA abundance and dynamically respond to changes in gene activity. Conversion of H3K79 monomethylation into di- and trimethylation correlated with the transition from low- to high-level gene transcription. We also observed enrichment of H3K79 monomethylation at intergenic regions occupied by DNA-binding transcriptional activators. Our findings highlight several similarities between the patterning of H3K4 methylation and that of H3K79 methylation in mammalian chromatin, suggesting a widespread mechanism for parallel or sequential recruitment of DOT1L and MLL to genes in their normal "on" state.},

They are required for proper homeotic gene expression, in part through methylation of histone H3 on Lys 4. In humans, the MLL gene is involved in a large number of chromosomal translocations that create chimeric proteins, fusing the N terminus of MLL to several proteins that share little sequence similarity. Several frequent translocation partners of MLL were found recently to coexist in a super elongation complex (SEC) that includes known transcription elongation factors such as eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) and P-TEFb.

To map potential transcriptional activation or repression domains of the MLL protein, yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain and MLL hybrid protein-expressing plasmids were cotransfected with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids in a transient transfection system. We found that MLL contains a strong activation domain and a repression domain. The former, located telomeric (3') to the breakpoint region, activated transcription 18-fold to {\textgreater} 200-fold, depending on the promoter and cell line used for transfection. A repression domain that repressed transcription 4-fold was located centromeric (5') to the breakpoint region of MLL. The MLL AT-hook domain protein was expressed in bacteria and was utilized in a gel mobility shift assay to assess DNA-binding activity. The MLL AT-hook domain could bind cruciform DNA, recognizing structure rather than sequence of the target DNA. In translocations involving MLL, loss of an activation domain with retention of a repression domain and a DNA-binding domain on the der(11) chromosome could alter the expression of downstream target genes, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for MLL in leukemia.},

	abstract = {Alterations of the proto-oncogene MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) are characteristic for a high proportion of acute leukemias, especially those occurring in infants. The activation of MLL is achieved either by an internal tandem duplication of 5' MLL exons or by chromosomal translocations that create chimeric proteins with the N-terminus of MLL fused to a variety of different partner proteins. A domain of MLL with significant homology to the eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases (MT domain) has been found to be essential for the transforming potential of the oncogenic MLL derivatives. Here we demonstrate that this domain specifically recognizes DNA with unmethylated CpG sequences. In gel mobility shifts, the presence of CpG was sufficient for binding of recombinant GST-MT protein to DNA. The introduction of 5-methylCpG on one or both DNA strands precluded an efficient interaction. In surface plasmon resonance a KD of approximately 3.3 x 10(-8) M was determined for the GST-MT/DNA complex formation. Site selection experiments and DNase I footprinting confirmed CpG as the target of the MT domain. Finally, this interaction was corroborated in vivo in reporter assays utilizing the DNA-binding properties of the MT domain in a hybrid MT-VP16 transactivator construct.},

The mechanism by which MEN1 acts as a tumor suppressor is unclear. We have recently shown that menin, the MEN1 protein product, interacts with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) family proteins in a histone methyltransferase complex including Ash2, Rbbp5, and WDR5. Here, we show that menin directly regulates expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27Kip1 and p18Ink4c. Menin activates transcription by means of a mechanism involving recruitment of MLL to the p27Kip1 and p18Ink4c promoters and coding regions. Loss of function of either MLL or menin results in down-regulation of p27Kip1 and p18Ink4c expression and deregulated cell growth. These findings suggest that regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor transcription by cooperative interaction between menin and MLL plays a central role in menin's activity as a tumor suppressor.},

This menin-associated complex methylates histone H3 on lysine 4. A subset of tumor-derived menin mutants lacks the associated histone methyltransferase activity. In addition, menin is associated with RNA polymerase II whose large subunit carboxyl-terminal domain is phosphorylated on Ser 5. Men1 knockout embryos and cells show decreased expression of the homeobox genes Hoxc6 and Hoxc8. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that menin is bound to the Hoxc8 locus.

This methylase activity is associated with Hox gene activation and H3 (Lys4) methylation at cis-regulatory sequences in vivo.

The quiescent fraction of these HSCs is greatly reduced, and they are unable to compete with wild-type cells in transplantation assays. Mice with Mll expression conditionally deleted in the hematopoietic system have grossly normal hematopoiesis in bone marrow, thymus, and spleen. However, transplanted Mll-deficient bone marrow cells are highly compromised in their ability to competitively reconstitute irradiated recipients.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Infants represent a very poor risk group for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We report treatment outcome for such patients treated with intensive therapy on consecutive Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1993, infants with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled onto CCG-107 (n = 99) and CCG-1883 (n = 135) protocols. Postconsolidation therapy was more intensive on CCG-1883. On both studies, prophylactic treatment of the CNS included both high-dose systemic chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy, in contrast to whole-brain radiotherapy, which was used in earlier studies.
RESULTS: Most patients ({\textgreater}95\%) achieved remission with induction therapy. The most frequent event was a marrow relapse (46 patients on CCG-107 and 66 patients on CCG- 1883). Four-year event-free survival was 33\% (SE = 4.7\%) on CCG-107 and 39\% (SE = 4.2\%) on CCG- 1883. Both studies represent an improvement compared with a 22\% (SE = 5.1\%) event-free survival for historical controls. Four-year cumulative probabilities of any marrow relapse or an isolated CNS relapse were, respectively, 49\% (SE = 5\%) and 9\% (SE = 3\%) on CCG-107 and 50\% (SE = 5\%) and 3\% (SE = 2\%) on CCG-1883, compared with 63\% (SE = 6\%) and 5\% (SE = 3\%) for the historical controls. Independent adverse prognostic factors were age less than 3 months, WBC count of more than 50,000/microL, CD10 negativity, slow response to induction therapy, and presence of the translocation t(4;11).
CONCLUSION: Outcome for infants on CCG-107 and CCG- 1883 improved, compared with historical controls. Marrow relapse remains the primary mode of failure. Isolated CNS relapse rates are low, indicating that intrathecal chemotherapy combined with very-high-dose systemic therapy provides adequate protection of the CNS. The overall unsatisfactory outcome observed for the infant ALL population warrants the future use of novel alternative therapies.},

The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for all 102 infants was 50.9\% (95\% confidence interval, 41.0-60.8\%). The most prominent late effect was growth impairment, observed in 58.9\% of all evaluable patients in the MLL-R group. This plan of risk-based therapy appears to have improved the overall prognosis for infants with ALL, compared with previously reported results. However, over half the events in patients with MLL rearrangement occurred before the instigation of HSCT, and that HSCT-related toxic events comprised 36.3\% (8/22) of post-transplantation events, suggesting that further stratification within the MLL-R group and the development of more effective early-phase intensification chemotherapy will be needed before the full potential of this strategy is realized.},

MLL is involved in chromosomal translocations, partial tandem duplications, and amplifications, all of which result in hematopoietic malignancies due to sustained HOX expression and stalled differentiation. MLL lesions are associated with both acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid leukemia and are usually associated with a relatively poor prognosis despite improved treatment options such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which underscores the need for new treatment regimens. Recent advances have begun to reveal the molecular mechanisms that drive MLL-associated leukemias, which, in turn, have provided opportunities for therapeutic development.

Approximately 10\% of all leukemias harbor MLL1 translocations.

In general, outcomes for all of these patients remain poor when compared to patients with non-MLL1 rearranged leukemias. In this review, we will discuss the normal biological roles of MLL1 and its fusion partners, how these roles are hypothesized to be dysregulated in the context of MLL1 rearrangements, and the clinical manifestations of this group of leukemias.

However, the advantage was restricted to a subgroup with 2 additional unfavorable prognostic features: age less than 6 months and either poor response to steroids at day 8 or leukocytes more than or equal to 300 g/L. Ninety-seven of 297 MLL(+) patients (33\%) had such high-risk criteria, with 87 achieving CR. In this group, HSCT was associated with a 64\% reduction in the risk of failure resulting from relapse or death in CR (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95\% confidence interval, 0.15-0.86). In the remaining patients, there was no advantage for HSCT over chemotherapy only. In summary, HSCT seems to be a valuable option for a subgroup of infant MLL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying further poor prognostic factors. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT00015873 and at www.controlled-trials.com as \#ISRCTN24251487.},

	abstract = {Chromosomal rearrangements of the human MLL/KMT2A gene are associated with infant, pediatric, adult and therapy-induced acute leukemias. Here we present the data obtained from 2345 acute leukemia patients. Genomic breakpoints within the MLL gene and the involved translocation partner genes (TPGs) were determined and 11 novel TPGs were identified. Thus, a total of 135 different MLL rearrangements have been identified so far, of which 94 TPGs are now characterized at the molecular level. In all, 35 out of these 94 TPGs occur recurrently, but only 9 specific gene fusions account for more than 90\% of all illegitimate recombinations of the MLL gene. We observed an age-dependent breakpoint shift with breakpoints localizing within MLL intron 11 associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and younger patients, while breakpoints in MLL intron 9 predominate in AML or older patients. The molecular characterization of MLL breakpoints suggests different etiologies in the different age groups and allows the correlation of functional domains of the MLL gene with clinical outcome. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the MLL recombinome in acute leukemia and demonstrates that the establishment of patient-specific chromosomal fusion sites allows the design of specific PCR primers for minimal residual disease analyses for all patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements and coexpression of myeloid markers. The Interfant-06 study, comprising 18 national and international study groups, tested whether myeloid-style consolidation chemotherapy is superior to lymphoid style, the role of stem-cell transplantation (SCT), and which factors had independent prognostic value.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three risk groups were defined: low risk (LR): KMT2A germline; high risk (HR): KMT2A-rearranged and older than 6 months with WBC count 300 × 109/L or more or a poor prednisone response; and medium risk (MR): all other KMT2A-rearranged cases. Patients in the MR and HR groups were randomly assigned to receive the lymphoid course low-dose cytosine arabinoside [araC], 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide (IB) or experimental myeloid courses, namely araC, daunorubicin, etoposide (ADE) and mitoxantrone, araC, etoposide (MAE).
RESULTS: A total of 651 infants were included, with 6-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival of 46.1\% (SE, 2.1) and 58.2\% (SE, 2.0). In West European/North American groups, 6-year EFS and overall survival were 49.4\% (SE, 2.5) and 62.1\% (SE, 2.4), which were 10\% to 12\% higher than in other countries. The 6-year probability of disease-free survival was comparable for the randomized arms (ADE+MAE 39.3\% [SE 4.0; n = 169] v IB 36.8\% [SE, 3.9; n = 161]; log-rank P = .47). The 6-year EFS rate of patients in the HR group was 20.9\% (SE, 3.4) with the intention to undergo SCT; only 46\% of them received SCT, because many had early events. KMT2A rearrangement was the strongest prognostic factor for EFS, followed by age, WBC count, and prednisone response.
CONCLUSION: Early intensification with postinduction myeloid-type chemotherapy courses did not significantly improve outcome for infant ALL compared with the lymphoid-type course IB. Outcome for infant ALL in Interfant-06 did not improve compared with that in Interfant-99.},

Natural history and molecular studies indicate that infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) originates in utero, is distinct from childhood ALL, and most cases are caused by MLL-r resulting in an oncogenic MLL fusion protein. Unlike childhood ALL, only a very small number of additional mutations are present in infant ALL, indicating that MLL-r alone may be sufficient to give rise to this rapid onset, aggressive leukaemia in an appropriate fetal cell context. Despite modifications in treatment approaches, the outcome of MLL-r infant ALL has remained dismal and a clear understanding of the underlying biology of the disease is required in order to develop appropriate disease models and more effective therapeutic strategies.},

This conversion involves activation of a haematopoietic transcriptional programme in a subset of endothelial cells in the major vasculature of the embryo, followed by major morphological changes that result in transitioning cells rounding up, breaking the tight junctions to neighbouring endothelial cells and adopting a haematopoietic fate. The whole process is co-ordinated by a complex interplay of key transcription factors and signalling pathways, with additional input from surrounding tissues. Diverse model systems, including mouse, chick and zebrafish embryos as well as differentiation of pluripotent cells in vitro, have contributed to the elucidation of the details of the EHT, which was greatly accelerated in recent years by sophisticated live imaging techniques and advances in transcriptional profiling, such as single-cell RNA-Seq. A detailed knowledge of these developmental events is required in order to be able to apply it to the generation of haematopoietic stem cells from pluripotent stem cells in vitro — an achievement which is of obvious clinical importance. The aim of this review is to summarise the latest findings and describe how these may have contributed towards achieving this goal.},

Dissecting EHT regulation is a critical step towards the production of in vitro derived HSCs. Yet, we do not know how distinct endothelial and haematopoietic fates are parsed during the transition. Here we show that genes required for arterial identity function later to repress haematopoietic fate. Tissue-specific, temporally controlled, genetic loss of arterial genes (Sox17 and Notch1) during EHT results in increased production of haematopoietic cells due to loss of Sox17-mediated repression of haematopoietic transcription factors (Runx1 and Gata2). However, the increase in EHT can be abrogated by increased Notch signalling. These findings demonstrate that the endothelial haematopoietic fate switch is actively repressed in a population of endothelial cells, and that derepression of these programs augments haematopoietic output., 
The first haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells arise from the hemogenic endothelium of arterial vascular beds. Here the authors describe the mechanism that regulates the endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition and show that Sox17 and Notch1, genes critical to arterial endothelium identity, are also crucial repressors of haematopoietic fate.},

The Notch target Hes1 is widely expressed in the aortic endothelium and hematopoietic clusters, though Hes1-deficient mice show no overt hematopoietic abnormalities. We now demonstrate that Hes is required for the development of HSC in the mouse embryo, a function previously undetected as the result of functional compensation by de novo expression of Hes5 in the aorta/gonad/mesonephros (AGM) region of Hes1 mutants. Analysis of embryos deficient for Hes1 and Hes5 reveals an intact arterial program with overproduction of nonfunctional hematopoietic precursors and total absence of HSC activity. These alterations were associated with increased expression of the hematopoietic regulators Runx1, c-myb, and the previously identified Notch target Gata2. By analyzing the Gata2 locus, we have identified functional RBPJ-binding sites, which mutation results in loss of Gata2 reporter expression in transgenic embryos, and functional Hes-binding sites, which mutation leads to specific Gata2 up-regulation in the hematopoietic precursors. Together, our findings show that Notch activation in the AGM triggers Gata2 and Hes1 transcription, and next HES-1 protein represses Gata2, creating an incoherent feed-forward loop required to restrict Gata2 expression in the emerging HSCs.},

Here, we show detailed analysis of Notch family gene expression in the aorta endothelium between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E10.5. Since Notch requires binding to RBPjkappa transcription factor to activate transcription, we analyzed the aorta of the para-aortic splanchnopleura/AGM in RBPjkappa mutant embryos. We found specific patterns of expression of Notch receptors, ligands and Hes genes that were lost in RBPjkappa mutants. Analysis of these mutants revealed the absence of hematopoietic progenitors, accompanied by the lack of expression of the hematopoietic transcription factors Aml1/Runx1, Gata2 and Scl/Tal1. We show that in wild-type embryos, a few cells lining the aorta endothelium at E9.5 simultaneously expressed Notch1 and Gata2, and demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation that Notch1 specifically associated with the Gata2 promoter in E9.5 wild-type embryos and 32D myeloid cells, an interaction lost in RBPjkappamutants. Consistent with a role for Notch1 in regulating Gata2, we observe increased expression of this gene in 32D cells expressing activated Notch1. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that activation of Gata2 expression by Notch1/RBPjkappa is a crucial event for the onset of definitive hematopoiesis in the embryo.},

	abstract = {RUNX1 a member of the family of runt related transcription factors (RUNX), is essential for hematopoiesis. The expression of RUNX1 gene is controlled by two promoters; the distal P1 promoter and the proximal P2 promoter. Several isoforms of RUNX1 mRNA are generated through the use of both promoters and alternative splicing. These isoforms not only differs in their temporal expression pattern but also exhibit differences in tissue specificity. The RUNX1 isoforms derived from P2 are expressed in a variety of tissues, but expression of P1-derived isoform is restricted to cells of hematopoietic lineage. However, the control of hematopoietic-cell specific expression is poorly understood. Here we report regulation of P1-derived RUNX1 mRNA by RUNX1 protein. In silico analysis of P1 promoter revealed presence of two evolutionary conserved RUNX motifs, 0.6kb upstream of the transcription start site, and three RUNX motifs within 170bp of the 5’UTR. Transcriptional contribution of these RUNX motifs was studied in myeloid and T-cells. RUNX1 genomic fragment containing all sites show very low basal activity in both cell types. Mutation or deletion of RUNX motifs in the UTR enhances basal activity of the RUNX1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that RUNX1 protein is recruited to these sites. Overexpression of RUNX1 in non-hematopoietic cells results in a dose dependent activation of the RUNX1 P1 promoter. We also demonstrate that RUNX1 protein regulates transcription of endogenous RUNX1 mRNA in T-cell. Finally we show that SCL transcription factor is recruited to regions containing RUNX motifs in the promoter and the UTR and regulates activity of the RUNX1 P1 promoter in vitro. Thus, multiple lines of evidence show that RUNX1 protein regulates its own gene transcription.},

Hematopoiesis is therefore a paradigm for investigating how transcription factors function in mammalian cells, thanks also to the evolution of genome-wide and the next-generation sequencing technologies. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of the biological and functional properties of the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 (also known as AML1, CBFA2, PEBP2aB) transcription factor and its main downstream target PU.1.

	abstract = {During ontogeny, the transcription factor RUNX1 governs the emergence of definitive hematopoietic cells from specialized endothelial cells called hemogenic endothelium (HE). The ultimate consequence of this endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition is the concomitant activation of the hematopoietic program and downregulation of the endothelial program. However, due to the rare and transient nature of the HE, little is known about the initial role of RUNX1 within this population. We, therefore, developed and implemented a highly sensitive DNA adenine methyltransferase identification-based methodology, including a novel data analysis pipeline, to map early RUNX1 transcriptional targets in HE cells. This novel transcription factor binding site identification protocol should be widely applicable to other low abundance cell types and factors. Integration of the RUNX1 binding profile with gene expression data revealed an unexpected early role for RUNX1 as a positive regulator of cell adhesion- and migration-associated genes within the HE. This suggests that RUNX1 orchestrates HE cell positioning and integration prior to the release of hematopoietic cells. Overall, our genome-wide analysis of the RUNX1 binding and transcriptional profile in the HE provides a novel comprehensive resource of target genes that will facilitate the precise dissection of the role of RUNX1 in early blood development.},

In this study we use the developing cone cell in the Drosophila visual system to elucidate the mechanism of positive and negative regulation by the Runx protein Lozenge (Lz). We describe a regulatory circuit in which Lz causes transcriptional activation of the homeodomain protein Cut, which can then stabilize a Lz repressor complex in the same cell. Whether a gene is activated or repressed is determined by whether the Lz activator or the repressor complex binds to its upstream sequence. This study provides a mechanistic basis for the dual function of Runx proteins that is likely to be conserved in mammalian systems.},

An upstream regulatory element (URE) of PU.1 has both enhancer and repressor activity and tightly regulates PU.1 expression. Here we show that AML1 binds to functionally important sites within the PU.1 upstream regulatory element and regulates PU.1 expression at both embryonic and adult stages of development. Analysis of mice carrying conditional AML1 knockout alleles and knock-in mice carrying mutations in all three AML1 sites of the URE proximal region demonstrated that AML1 regulates PU.1 both positively and negatively in a lineage dependent manner. Dysregulation of PU.1 expression contributed to each of the phenotypes observed in these mice, and restoration of proper PU.1 expression rescued or partially rescued each phenotype.

	abstract = {Shifting sites of blood cell production during development is common across widely divergent phyla. In zebrafish, like other vertebrates, hematopoietic development has been roughly divided into two waves, termed primitive and definitive. Primitive hematopoiesis is characterized by the generation of embryonic erythrocytes in the intermediate cell mass and a distinct population of macrophages that arises from cephalic mesoderm. Based on previous gene expression studies, definitive hematopoiesis has been suggested to begin with the generation of presumptive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) along the dorsal aorta that express c-myb and runx1. Here we show, using a combination of gene expression analyses, prospective isolation approaches,transplantation, and in vivo lineage-tracing experiments, that definitive hematopoiesis initiates through committed erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the posterior blood island (PBI) that arise independently of HSCs. EMPs isolated by coexpression of fluorescent transgenes driven by the lmo2and gata1 promoters exhibit an immature, blastic morphology and express only erythroid and myeloid genes. Transplanted EMPs home to the PBI,show limited proliferative potential, and do not seed subsequent hematopoietic sites such as the thymus or pronephros. In vivo fate-mapping studies similarly demonstrate that EMPs possess only transient proliferative potential, with differentiated progeny remaining largely within caudal hematopoietic tissue. Additional fate mapping of mesodermal derivatives in mid-somitogenesis embryos suggests that EMPs are born directly in the PBI. These studies provide phenotypic and functional analyses of the first hematopoietic progenitors in the zebrafish embryo and demonstrate that definitive hematopoiesis proceeds through two distinct waves during embryonic development.},

	abstract = {In this study, we have mapped the onset of hematopoietic development in the mouse embryo using colony-forming progenitor assays and PCR-based gene expression analysis. With this approach, we demonstrate that commitment of embryonic cells to hematopoietic fates begins in proximal regions of the egg cylinder at the mid-primitive streak stage (E7.0) with the simultaneous appearance of primitive erythroid and macrophage progenitors. Development of these progenitors was associated with the expression of SCL/tal-1 and GATA-1, genes known to be involved in the development and maturation of the hematopoietic system. Kinetic analysis revealed the transient nature of the primitive erythroid lineage, as progenitors increased in number in the developing yolk sac until early somite-pair stages of development (E8.25) and then declined sharply to undetectable levels by 20 somite pairs (E9.0). Primitive erythroid progenitors were not detected in any other tissue at any stage of embryonic development. The early wave of primitive erythropoiesis was followed by the appearance of definitive erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) that were first detectable at 1-7 somite pairs (E8.25) exclusively within the yolk sac. The appearance of BFU-E was followed by the development of later stage definitive erythroid (CFU-E), mast cell and bipotential granulocyte/macrophage progenitors in the yolk sac. C-myb, a gene essential for definitive hematopoiesis, was expressed at low levels in the yolk sac just prior to and during the early development of these definitive erythroid progenitors. All hematopoietic activity was localized to the yolk sac until circulation was established (E8.5) at which time progenitors from all lineages were detected in the bloodstream and subsequently in the fetal liver following its development. This pattern of development suggests that definitive hematopoietic progenitors arise in the yolk sac, migrate through the bloodstream and seed the fetal liver to rapidly initiate the first phase of intraembryonic hematopoiesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that commitment to hematopoietic fates begins in early gastrulation, that the yolk sac is the only site of primitive erythropoiesis and that the yolk sac serves as the first source of definitive hematopoietic progenitors during embryonic development.},

	abstract = {One of the important challenges in the emerging field of synthetic biology is designing artificial networks that achieve coordinated behavior in cell communities. Here we present a synthetic multicellular bacterial system where receiver cells exhibit transient gene expression in response to a long-lasting signal from neighboring sender cells. The engineered sender cells synthesize an inducer, an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which freely diffuses to spatially proximate receiver cells. The receiver cells contain a pulse-generator circuit that incorporates a feed-forward regulatory motif. The circuit responds to a long-lasting increase in the level of AHL by transiently activating, and then repressing, the expression of a GFP. Based on simulation models, we engineered variants of the pulse-generator circuit that exhibit different quantitative responses such as increased duration and intensity of the pulse. As shown by our models and experiments, the maximum amplitude and timing of the pulse depend not only on the final inducer concentration, but also on its rate of increase. The ability to differentiate between various rates of increase in inducer concentrations affords the system a unique spatiotemporal behavior for cells grown on solid media. Specifically, receiver cells can respond to communication from nearby sender cells while completely ignoring communication from senders cells further away, despite the fact that AHL concentrations eventually reach high levels everywhere. Because of the resemblance to naturally occurring feed-forward motifs, the pulse generator can serve as a model to improve our understanding of such systems.},

We analyze the dynamics of this motif by means of high-resolution expression measurements in the flagella gene-regulation network, the system that allows Escherichia coli to swim. In this system, the master regulator FlhDC activates a second regulator, FliA, and both activate in an additive fashion the operons that produce the flagella motor. We find that this motif prolongs flagella expression following deactivation of the master regulator, protecting flagella production from transient loss of input signal. Thus, in contrast to the AND-FFL that shows a delay following signal activation, the SUM-FFL shows delays after signal deactivation. The SUM-FFL in this system works as theoretically predicted despite being embedded in at least two additional feedback loops. The present function might be carried out by the SUM-FFL in systems found across organisms.},

It is important to understand whether these network motifs have specific functions. One of the most significant network motifs is the coherent feedforward loop, in which transcription factor X regulates transcription factor Y, and both jointly regulate gene Z. On the basis of mathematical modeling and simulations, it was suggested that the coherent feedforward loop could serve as a sign-sensitive delay element: a circuit that responds rapidly to step-like stimuli in one direction (e.g. ON to OFF), and at a delay to steps in the opposite direction (OFF to ON). Is this function actually carried out by feedforward loops in living cells? Here, we address this experimentally, using a system with feedforward loop connectivity, the L-arabinose utilization system of Escherichia coli. We measured responses to step-like cAMP stimuli at high temporal resolution and accuracy by means of green fluorescent protein reporters. We show that the arabinose system displays sign-sensitive delay kinetics. This type of kinetics is important for making decisions based on noisy inputs by filtering out fluctuations in input stimuli, yet allowing rapid response. This information-processing function may be performed by the feedforward loop regulation modules that are found in diverse systems from bacteria to humans.},

Often, these structured patterns can be formalized as motifs and described using a proper mathematical model such as position weight matrix and IUPAC consensus. Two key tasks are typically carried out for motifs in the context of the analysis of genomic sequences. These are: identification in a set of DNA regions of over-represented motifs from a particular motif database, and de novo discovery of over-represented motifs. Here we describe existing methodology to perform these two tasks for motifs characterizing transcription factor binding. When applied to the output of ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments, or to promoter regions of co-modulated genes, motif analysis techniques allow for the prediction of transcription factor binding events and enable identification of transcriptional regulators and co-regulators. The usefulness of motif analysis is further exemplified in this review by how motif discovery improves peak calling in ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments and, when coupled with information on gene expression, allows insights into physical mechanisms of transcriptional modulation.},

Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data.

	abstract = {Plants are fascinating and complex organisms. A comprehensive understanding of the organization, function and evolution of plant genes is essential to disentangle important biological processes and to advance crop engineering and breeding strategies. The ultimate aim in deciphering complex biological processes is the discovery of causal genes and regulatory mechanisms controlling these processes. The recent surge of omics data has opened the door to a system-wide understanding of the flow of biological information underlying complex traits. However, dealing with the corresponding large data sets represents a challenging endeavor that calls for the development of powerful bioinformatics methods. A popular approach is the construction and analysis of gene networks. Such networks are often used for genome-wide representation of the complex functional organization of biological systems. Network based on similarity in gene expression are called (gene) co-expression networks. One of the major application of gene co-expression networks is the functional annotation of unknown genes. Constructing co-expression networks is generally straightforward. In contrast, the resulting network of connected genes can become very complex, which limits its biological interpretation. Several strategies can be employed to enhance the interpretation of the networks. A strategy in coherence with the biological question addressed needs to be established to infer reliable networks. Additional benefits can be gained from network-based strategies using prior knowledge and data integration to further enhance the elucidation of gene regulatory relationships. As a result, biological networks provide many more applications beyond the simple visualization of co-expressed genes. In this study we review the different approaches for co-expression network inference in plants. We analyse integrative genomics strategies used in recent studies that successfully identified candidate genes taking advantage of gene co-expression networks. Additionally, we discuss promising bioinformatics approaches that predict networks for specific purposes.},

RESULTS: We introduce Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN) that share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks, but are robust in the face of uncertainty. We show how the dynamics of these networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of Markov chains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases. Then, we discuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks--a family of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilistic relationships between variables. We show how probabilistic dependencies between a gene and its parent genes, constituting the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained from PBNs. Finally, we present methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes, within the context of PBNs. Examples illustrating the above concepts are presented throughout the paper.},

	abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental molecular mechanism involved in almost every aspect of life, from homeostasis to development, from metabolism to behavior, from reaction to stimuli to disease progression. In recent years, the concept of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) has grown popular as an effective applied biology approach for describing the complex and highly dynamic set of transcriptional interactions, due to its easy-to-interpret features. Since cataloguing, predicting and understanding every GRN connection in all species and cellular contexts remains a great challenge for biology, researchers have developed numerous tools and methods to infer regulatory processes. In this review, we catalogue these methods in six major areas, based on the dominant underlying information leveraged to infer GRNs: Coexpression, Sequence Motifs, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Orthology, Literature and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) specifically focused on transcriptional complexes. The methods described here cover a wide range of user-friendliness: from web tools that require no prior computational expertise to command line programs and algorithms for large scale GRN inferences. Each method for GRN inference described herein effectively illustrates a type of transcriptional relationship, with many methods being complementary to others. While a truly holistic approach for inferring and displaying GRNs remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of systems biology, we believe that the integration of multiple methods described herein provides an effective means with which experimental and computational biologists alike may obtain the most complete pictures of transcriptional relationships.

Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene expression data derived from microarrays. However, the incorporation of additional information from heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and protein–DNA interaction data, clearly supports the network inference process. This review focuses on promising modelling approaches that use such diverse types of molecular biological information. In particular, approaches are discussed that enable the modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems.

	abstract = {The regulation of gene expression is mediated at the transcriptional level by enhancer regions that are bound by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). Recent studies have shown that the in vivo binding sites of single TFs differ between developmental or cellular contexts. How this context-specific binding is encoded in the cis-regulatory DNA sequence has, however, remained unclear. We computationally dissect context-specific TF binding sites in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and human and find distinct combinations of sequence motifs for partner factors, which are predictive and reveal specific motif requirements of individual binding sites. We predict that TF binding in the early Drosophila embryo depends on motifs for the early zygotic TFs Vielfaltig (also known as Zelda) and Tramtrack. We validate experimentally that the activity of Twist-bound enhancers and Twist binding itself depend on Vielfaltig motifs, suggesting that Vielfaltig is more generally important for early transcription. Our finding that the motif content can predict context-specific binding and that the predictions work across different Drosophila species suggests that characteristic motif combinations are shared between sites, revealing context-specific motif codes (cis-regulatory signatures), which appear to be conserved during evolution. Taken together, this study establishes a novel approach to derive predictive cis-regulatory motif requirements for individual TF binding sites and enhancers. Importantly, the method is generally applicable across different cell types and organisms to elucidate cis-regulatory sequence determinants and the corresponding trans-acting factors from the increasing number of tissue- and cell-type-specific TF binding studies.},

	abstract = {This study concerns the organization of sites of specific DNA/protein interaction within the regulatory domain of the Endo16 gene of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Earlier work had displayed a complex pattern of expression of this gene during embryogenesis. Endo16 transcripts are confined to the definitive vegetal plate in blastula stage embryos; at gastrula stage this gene is expressed throughout the archenteron, but later only in the midgut. In this work we exploited the exceptional experimental accessibility of the sea urchin embryo, with respect to both functional assays of gene regulatory systems and to characterization of transcription factors, in order to approach a complete description of potential Endo16 regulatory interactions. Accurate expression of an Endo16 fusion gene was obtained with a 2200-nucleotide (nt) upstream fragment of the gene. We present a map locating high specificity target sites for DNA-binding proteins within the 2200-nt Endo16 regulatory domain, and an assessment of the complexity of the set of putative Endo16 transcription factors that we have been able to recover from 24-h (blastula stage) nuclear extract. Protein binding sites were initially mapped by gel shift reactions carried out on nested sets of end-labeled restriction fragments, and then to finer resolution by oligonucleotide gel shift competitions. Thirty-eight sites of high specificity DNA-protein interaction were thus identified. Appropriate oligonucleotides were then used for partial purification of the DNA-binding proteins by affinity chromatography. DNA-binding proteins specific for each target site were identified by molecular weight, using southwestern blotting procedures and two-dimensional gel shift separations, and by directly renaturing and reacting with oligonucleotide probes specific proteins that had been resolved by SDS-PAGE from selected affinity column fractions. A complete series of gel shift cross-competitions amongst the target sites was carried out. We conclude that nine different protein factors are bound at unique sites within the Endo16 regulatory domain. Multiple target sites for five other proteins account for the remaining binding site locations. The target sites appear to be organized in a sequence of clusters, focused on the unique factors. The high complexity of the Endo16 gene regulatory system may be characteristic for genes that are spatially regulated in early embryonic development.},

Given a set of genomic regions, it performs (i) ab initio motif discovery, (ii) motif enrichment analysis, (iii) motif visualization, (iv) binding affinity analysis and (v) motif identification. It runs two complementary motif discovery algorithms on the input data--MEME and DREME--and uses the motifs they discover in subsequent visualization, binding affinity and identification steps. MEME-ChIP also performs motif enrichment analysis using the AME algorithm, which can detect very low levels of enrichment of binding sites for TFs with known DNA-binding motifs. Importantly, unlike with the MEME web service, there is no restriction on the size or number of uploaded sequences, allowing very large ChIP-seq datasets to be analyzed. The analyses performed by MEME-ChIP provide the user with a varied view of the binding and regulatory activity of the ChIP-ed TF, as well as the possible involvement of other DNA-binding TFs.
AVAILABILITY: MEME-ChIP is available as part of the MEME Suite at http://meme.nbcr.net.},

	abstract = {Many biologically significant processes, such as cell differentiation and cell cycle progression, gene transcription and DNA replication, chromosome stability and epigenetic silencing etc. depend on the crucial interactions between cellular proteins and DNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is an important experimental technique for studying interactions between specific proteins and DNA in the cell and determining their localization on a specific genomic locus. In recent years, the combination of ChIP with second generation DNA-sequencing technology (ChIP-seq) allows precise genomic functional assay. This review addresses the important applications of ChIP-seq with an emphasis on its role in genome-wide mapping of transcription factor binding sites, the revelation of underlying molecular mechanisms of differential gene regulation that are governed by specific transcription factors, and the identification of epigenetic marks. Furthermore, we also describe the ChIP-seq data analysis workflow and a perspective for the exciting potential advancement of ChIP-seq technology in the future.},

As a model system, we examined how targeting and transcriptional control of the sulfur metabolism genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is governed by recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator Met4. We developed genome-scale approaches to measure transcription factor (TF) DNA-binding affinities and cofactor recruitment to {\textgreater}1300 genomic binding site sequences. We report that genes responding to the TF Cbf1 and cofactor Met28 contain a novel 'recruitment motif' (RYAAT), adjacent to Cbf1 binding sites, which enhances the binding of a Met4-Met28-Cbf1 regulatory complex, and that abrogation of this motif significantly reduces gene induction under low-sulfur conditions. Furthermore, we show that correct recognition of this composite motif requires both non-DNA-binding cofactors Met4 and Met28. Finally, we demonstrate that the presence of an RYAAT motif next to a Cbf1 site, rather than Cbf1 binding affinity, specifies Cbf1-dependent sulfur metabolism genes. Our results highlight the need to examine TF/cofactor complexes, as novel specificity can result from cofactors that lack intrinsic DNA-binding specificity.},

The biological consequences of the c-Myb(M303V/M303V) mutation include thrombocytosis, megakaryocytosis, anemia, lymphopenia, and the absence of eosinophils. Detailed analysis of hematopoiesis in c-Myb(M303V/M303V) mice reveals distinct blocks in T cell, B cell, and red blood cell development, as well as a remarkable 10-fold increase in the number of HSCs. Cell cycle analyses show that twice as many HSCs from c-Myb(M303V/M303V) animals are actively cycling.

CBP interacts with the activated phosphorylated form of CREB but not with the nonphosphorylated form. We report here that CBP is also a coactivator of the c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb), which is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator. CBP directly binds to the region containing the transcriptional activation domain of c-Myb in a phosphorylation-independent manner in vitro. The domain of CBP that touches c-Myb is also required for binding to CREB. A c-Myb/CBP complex in vivo was demonstrated by a yeast two-hybrid assay. CBP stimulates the c-Myb-dependent transcriptional activation. Conversely, the expression of antisense RNA of CBP represses c-Myb-induced transcriptional activation. In addition, adenovirus EIA, which binds to CBP, inhibits c-Myb-induced transcriptional activation. Our data thus identify CBP as a coactivator of c-Myb. These results suggest that CBP functions as a coactivator for more transcriptional activators than were thought previously.},

This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions.

But taking full advantage of the new data requires advanced algorithms that take into account the biophysical processes involved in generating the data. The new large datasets can also aid in determining when the PWM model is inadequate and must be extended to provide accurate predictions of binding sites. This article provides a general mathematical description of a PWM and how it is used to score potential binding sites, a brief history of the approaches that have been developed and the types of data that are used with an emphasis on algorithms that we have developed for analyzing high-throughput datasets from several new technologies. It also describes extensions that can be added when the simple PWM model is inadequate and further enhancements that may be necessary. It briefly describes some applications of PWMs in the discovery and modeling of in vivo regulatory networks.},

Emerging evidence links the transcriptional consequences of BET inhibition to the association of Brd4 with enhancer elements, which tend to be involved in lineage-specific gene regulation. Furthermore, Brd4 engages in direct regulatory interactions with several DNA-binding transcription factors to influence their disease-relevant functions.

Super-enhancers of transcription are identified by enrichment of H3K27Ac. BET inhibitor JQ1 disrupts BRD4 association with super-enhancers, downregulates proto-oncogenes, such as c-Myc, and displays antitumor activity in preclinical animal models of human cancers. Here we show that an enhancer proximal to the c-Myc promoter is enriched in H3K27Ac and associated with high occupancy of BRD4, and coincides with a putative c-Myc super-enhancer in MCC cells. This observation is mirrored in tumors from MCC patients. Importantly, depleted BRD4 occupancy at the putative c-Myc super-enhancer region by JQ1 correlates with decreased c-Myc expression. Thus, our study provides initial evidence that super-enhancers regulate c-Myc expression in MCC.},

We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

	abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, the DNA molecule is found in the form of a nucleoprotein complex named chromatin. The basic unit of the chromatin is the nucleosome, which comprises 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histones (made of two molecules of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones). Each nucleosome is linked to the next by small segments of linker DNA. Most chromatin is further condensated by winding in a polynucleosome fibre, which may be stabilized through the binding of histone H1 to each nucleosome and to the linker DNA. The modulation of the structure of the chromatin fibre is critical for the regulation of gene expression since it determines the accessibility and the sequential recruitment of regulatory factors to the underlying DNA. Depending on the different transcriptional states, the structure of the chromatin may be altered in its constituents (e.g. the presence of repressors, activators, chromatin remodelling complexes, and/or incorporation of histone variants), and in covalent modifications of its constituents (such as DNA methylation at cytosine residues, and posttranslational modifications of histone tails). Here, we give an overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in chromatin regulation and the epigenetic transmission of its state, both in normal and pathological scenarios.},

In order to define a core set of MLL rearranged targets, we investigated the genome-wide binding of the MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 fusion proteins and associated epigenetic signatures in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines THP-1 and MV4-11. We uncovered both common as well as specific MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 target genes, which were all marked by H3K79me2, H3K27ac and H3K4me3. Apart from promoter binding, we also identified MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 binding at specific subsets of non-overlapping active distal regulatory elements. Despite this differential enhancer binding, MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 still direct a common gene program, which represents part of the RUNX1 gene program and constitutes of CD34+ and monocyte-specific genes. Comparing these data sets identified several zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) as potential MLL-AF9 co-regulators. Together, these results suggest that MLL fusions collaborate with specific subsets of TFs to deregulate the RUNX1 gene program in 11q23 AMLs.},

Over the past several decades, many computational methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and searching with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any motif-based sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific frequency matrix.Results: We describe Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO), a software tool for scanning DNA or protein sequences with motifs described as position-specific scoring matrices. The program computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a given sequence database, uses established dynamic programming methods to convert this score to a P-value and then applies false discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in the given sequence. FIMO provides output in a variety of formats, including HTML, XML and several Santa Cruz Genome Browser formats. The program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of DNA sequences at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single CPU.Availability and Implementation: FIMO is part of the MEME Suite software toolkit.

	abstract = {Understanding complex tissues requires single-cell deconstruction of gene regulation with precision and scale. Here, we assess the performance of a massively parallel droplet-based method for mapping transposase-accessible chromatin in single cells using sequencing (scATAC-seq). We apply scATAC-seq to obtain chromatin profiles of more than 200,000 single cells in human blood and basal cell carcinoma. In blood, application of scATAC-seq enables marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity and reconstruction of trajectories of cellular differentiation. In basal cell carcinoma, application of scATAC-seq reveals regulatory networks in malignant, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of scATAC-seq profiles from serial tumor biopsies before and after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade identifies chromatin regulators of therapy-responsive T cell subsets and reveals a shared regulatory program that governs intratumoral CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development. We anticipate that scATAC-seq will enable the unbiased discovery of gene regulatory factors across diverse biological systems.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used to study gene expression at the level of individual cells. However, preparing raw sequence data for further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases, artifacts and other sources of unwanted variation are present in the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization.

Results
We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalization and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a convenient, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for single-cell data and a flexible data structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be used as infrastructure for future software development.

Availability and Implementation
The open-source code, along with installation instructions, vignettes and case studies, is available through Bioconductor at http://bioconductor.org/packages/scater.

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data exhibits significant cell-to-cell variation due to technical factors, including the number of molecules detected in each cell, which can confound biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are generated de novo from a subset of endothelium, the hemogenic endothelium (HE), via a process called the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). To facilitate the study of HE throughout this process, our lab generated a Runx1 enhancer-reporter mouse model (23GFP) to dissect the cellular and molecular events that underlie EHT. Previous work in the lab highlighted that HE undergoes dynamic fate changes already early in development characterized by two distinct states, a competent state (cHE) and a specifying stage (sHE). In the context of EHT, this study rewrote the timeline of hematopoietic commitment during EHT and showed this is initiated in sHE before the proHSC and type I and type II preHSC stages. My aim was to identify and characterize the gene regulatory interactions (GRIs) underlying these cell fate transitions. We reasoned that integration of expression (RNA-seq) and chromatin profiles (ATAC-seq) would facilitate identification of these GRIs. After validating and characterizing the data sets, we focused on TFs where the timing and appearance of the motif coincided with expression of the TF and identified these as putative regulators of accessibility and subsequent changes in gene expression. Focusing on two key cell fate transitions: (1) cHE to sHE and (2) sHE to proHSC, we generated GRI maps. Analysis of these regulatory interactions identified putative causative regulators, including Bcl11a, Mef2c, Ikzf1, and Ikzf2. Looking more closely at Ikzf1, we identified a -28 element required for proper Ikzf1 expression. Interestingly, -28 activity was Runx1-dependent. Further investigation identified Notch signaling as a downstream target of the novel the Runx1-Ikzf1 regulatory axis. Finally, interrogation of this regulatory axis using genetic perturbation revealed a complex interaction whereby Runx1 and Ikzf1 work both individually and synergistically to regulate Notch during in vitro EHT.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The content of disorder increases with evolution indicating a possibly important role of disorder in the regulation of cellular systems. Transcription factors are no exception and several proteins of this class have recently been characterized as premolten/molten globules.

	abstract = {Pioneer transcription factors have the intrinsic biochemical ability to scan partial DNA sequence motifs that are exposed on the surface of a nucleosome and thus access silent genes that are inaccessible to other transcription factors. Pioneer factors subsequently enable other transcription factors, nucleosome remodeling complexes, and histone modifiers to engage chromatin, thereby initiating the formation of an activating or repressive regulatory sequence. Thus, pioneer factors endow the competence for fate changes in embryonic development, are essential for cellular reprogramming, and rewire gene networks in cancer cells. Recent studies with reconstituted nucleosomes in vitro and chromatin binding in vivo reveal that pioneer factors can directly perturb nucleosome structure and chromatin accessibility in different ways. This review focuses on our current understanding of the mechanisms by which pioneer factors initiate gene network changes and will ultimately contribute to our ability to control cell fates at will.},

	abstract = {The Ikzf1 locus encodes the lymphoid specific transcription factor Ikaros, which plays an essential role in both T and B cell differentiation, while deregulation or mutation of IKZF1/Ikzf1 is involved in leukemia. Tissue-specific and cell identity genes are usually associated with clusters of enhancers, also called super-enhancers, which are believed to ensure proper regulation of gene expression throughout cell development and differentiation. Several potential regulatory regions have been identified in close proximity of Ikzf1, however, the full extent of the regulatory landscape of the Ikzf1 locus is not yet established. In this study, we combined epigenomics and transcription factor binding along with high-throughput enhancer assay and 4C-seq to prioritize an enhancer element located 120 kb upstream of the Ikzf1 gene. We found that deletion of the E120 enhancer resulted in a significant reduction of Ikzf1 mRNA. However, the epigenetic landscape and 3D topology of the locus were only slightly affected, highlighting the complexity of the regulatory landscape regulating the Ikzf1 locus.},

	abstract = {Development of the skin epidermis and appendages such as hair follicles involves coordinated processes of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. The transcription factor p63 plays a critical role in these steps as evident by a complete lack of these structures in p63 null mice. The p63 gene encodes for two proteins TAp63 and DeltaNp63, the latter being the more prevalent and dominant isoform expressed in keratinocytes. Although numerous p63 target genes have been identified, these studies have been limited to transformed human keratinocyte cell lines. Here, we have employed a genomic screening approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with an enrichment strategy to identify DeltaNp63 response elements in primary mouse keratinocytes. Analysis of p63-ChIP-derived DNA segments has revealed more than 100 potential target genes including novel as well as mouse counterparts of established human p63 targets. Among these is Runx1, a transcription factor important for hair follicle development. We demonstrate that DeltaNp63 binds to a p63-response element located within a well-conserved enhancer of the Runx1 gene. Furthermore, siRNA mediated reduction of DeltaNp63 in mouse keratinocytes reduces Runx1 expression. Consistent with this, endogenous Runx1 levels are lower in the skin of p63(+/-) animals as compared to wild type animals. Lastly, we demonstrate that DeltaNp63 and Runx1 are co-expressed in specific compartments of the hair follicle in a dynamic fashion. Taken together our data demonstrate that p63 directly regulates Runx1 gene expression through a novel enhancer element and suggests a role for these two transcription factors in dictating skin keratinocyte and appendage development.},

	abstract = {Runx1 is an important haematopoietic transcription factor as stressed by its involvement in a number of haematological malignancies. Furthermore, it is a key regulator of the emergence of the first haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during development. The transcription factor Gata3 has also been linked to haematological disease and was shown to promote HSC production in the embryo by inducing the secretion of important niche factors. Both proteins are expressed in several different cell types within the aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM) region, in which the first HSCs are generated; however, a direct interaction between these two key transcription factors in the context of embryonic HSC production has not formally been demonstrated. In this current study, we have detected co-localisation of Runx1 and Gata3 in rare sub-aortic mesenchymal cells in the AGM. Furthermore, the expression of Runx1 is reduced in Gata3 -/- embryos, which also display a shift in HSC emergence. Using an AGM-derived cell line as a model for the stromal microenvironment in the AGM and performing ChIP-Seq and ChIP-on-chip experiments, we demonstrate that Runx1, together with other key niche factors, is a direct target gene of Gata3. In addition, we can pinpoint Gata3 binding to the Runx1 locus at specific enhancer elements which are active in the microenvironment. These results reveal a direct interaction between Gata3 and Runx1 in the niche that supports embryonic HSCs and highlight a dual role for Runx1 in driving the transdifferentiation of haemogenic endothelial cells into HSCs as well as in the stromal cells that support this process.},

Furthermore, AML cells undergo extensive clonal evolution, and the mutations in signaling genes are often secondary events. To elucidate how chronic growth factor signaling alters the transcriptional network in AML, we performed a system-wide multi-omics study of primary cells from patients suffering from AML with internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 transmembrane domain (FLT3-ITD). This strategy revealed cooperation between the MAP kinase (MAPK) inducible transcription factor AP-1 and RUNX1 as a major driver of a common, FLT3-ITD-specific gene expression and chromatin signature, demonstrating a major impact of MAPK signaling pathways in shaping the epigenome of FLT3-ITD AML.},

We found that this translocation did not generate RUNX1 fusion but aberrantly upregulated RUNX1. This upregulation was attributed to the disruption of long-range chromatin interactions between the RUNX1 P2 promoter and a silencer in the first intron of the gene. Characterization of the silencer revealed a role of SNAG repressors and their corepressor LSD1/KDM1A in mediating the effect. Our findings suggest that chromosomal rearrangements may activate RUNX1 by perturbing its transcriptional control to contribute to AML pathogenesis, in keeping with an emerging oncogenic role of RUNX1 in leukemia.},

The Runx1 +24 mCNE was found to possess hematopoietic-specific enhancer activity in both zebrafish and mouse models. Significantly, this enhancer is active specifically in hemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) at sites where the de novo generation of HSCs occurs. The activity of this enhancer is also strictly restricted to HSCs within the hematopoietic compartment of the adult bone marrow.

Runx1 is transcribed from two promoters, P1 and P2, to give rise to different protein isoforms. Although the expression of Runx1 must be tightly regulated for normal blood development, the mechanisms that regulate Runx1 isoform expression during haematopoiesis remain poorly understood. Gene regulatory elements located in non-coding DNA are likely to be important for Runx1 transcription. Here we use circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing to identify DNA interactions with the P1 and P2 promoters of Runx1, and the previously identified +24 enhancer, in the mouse multipotent haematopoietic progenitor cell line HPC-7. The active promoter, P1, interacts with nine non-coding regions that are occupied by transcription factors within a 1 Mb topologically associated domain. Eight of nine regions function as blood-specific enhancers in zebrafish, of which two were previously shown to harbour blood-specific enhancer activity in mice. Interestingly, the +24 enhancer interacted with multiple distant regions on chromosome 16, suggesting it may regulate the expression of additional genes. The Runx1 DNA contact map identifies connections with multiple novel and known haematopoietic enhancers that are likely to be involved in regulating Runx1 expression in haematopoietic progenitor cells.},

As in bilaterian embryogenesis, early development in Amphimedon involves activating and repressive chromatin in regions both proximal and distal to transcription start sites. Transcriptionally repressive elements ("silencers") are prominent during late embryogenesis. They coincide with an increase in cis-regulatory regions harboring metazoan TF binding motifs, as well as an increase in the expression of metazoan-specific genes.

Their numbers in this region increase thereafter and begin to decline at E12.5, thus pointing to the possible existence of both positive and negative regulators of emerging hematopoietic stem cells. Our recent expression analysis of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region showed that the Delta-like homologue 1 (Dlk1) gene is up-regulated in the region of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros where hematopoietic stem cells are preferentially located. To analyze its function, we studied Dlk1 expression in wild-type and hematopoietic stem cell-deficient embryos and determined hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell activity in Dlk1 knockout and overexpressing mice. Its role in hematopoietic support was studied in co-culture experiments using stromal cell lines that express varying levels of Dlk1. We show here that Dlk1 is expressed in the smooth muscle layer of the dorsal aorta and the ventral sub-aortic mesenchyme, where its expression is dependent on the hematopoietic transcription factor Runx1. We further demonstrate that Dlk1 has a negative impact on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell activity in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region in vivo, which is recapitulated in co-cultures of hematopoietic stem cells on stromal cells that express varying levels of Dlk1. This negative effect of Dlk1 on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell activity requires the membrane-bound form of the protein and cannot be recapitulated by soluble Dlk1. Together, these data suggest that Dlk1 expression by cells of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros hematopoietic microenvironment limits hematopoietic stem cell expansion and is, to our knowledge, the first description of such a negative regulator in this tissue.},

NAT10 mRNA expression levels were detected by real-time qPCR. Clinical data was obtained from inpatient medical records. Results: Two microarrays in Oncomine showed that NAT10 was upregulated in AML. Our data revealed that AML patients had higher NAT10 expression levels than the normal controls (P {\textless} 0.01). NPM1-mutant patients had higher NAT10 mRNA levels than NPM1-wt patients. NAT10 expression level was higher in nonremission group than in overall remission group (P {\textless} 0.05). High NAT10 expression indicated a poor progression-free survival and overall survival.

NAT10 is also a potential biomarker in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the mechanisms underlying NAT10's contribution to disease states and the effect of targeting NAT10 as a therapeutic target remain unclear. NAT10 was found to be highly expressed in patients with AML, and increased NAT10 expression was associated with poor outcomes. Additionally, targeting NAT10 via the shRNA knockdown and its pharmacotherapeutic inhibitor resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, and apoptosis in AML cells. Moreover, NAT10 induces cell cycle arrest by decreasing expression of CDK2, CDK4, CyclinD1, Cyclin E while simultaneously increasing the expression of p16 and p21. Targeting NAT10 induces ER stress through the increased expression of GRP78 and the cleavage of caspase 12, which are classical markers of ER stress. This triggered the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway by consequently increasing IRE1, CHOP, and PERK expression, all of which play crucial roles in the UPR pathway. Targeting NAT10 also activated the classical apoptotic pathway through the upregulation of the Bax/bak and the concurrent downregulation of Bcl-2. In summary, our data indicate that targeting NAT10 promotes ER stress, triggers the UPR pathway, and activates the Bax/Bcl-2 axis in AML cells. Our results thus indicate a novel mechanism underlying the induction of NAT10 inhibition-mediated apoptosis and reveal the potential for the therapeutic effect of a NAT10 specific inhibitor in AML.},

	abstract = {Neutrophils play an essential role in the innate immune defense system in vertebrates. During hematopoiesis, the full function of neutrophils involves maturation of granules and related enzymes. Yet, transcription regulators that promote neutrophil maturation remain largely undefined. Here, two hematopoiesis-defective zebrafish mutants, runx1w84x and c-mybhkz3, were used to investigate the in vivo roles of Runx1 in cooperation with c-Myb in regulating neutrophil maturation. Loss of runx1 impairs primitive neutrophil development. Additional regulation of c-myb+/− and c-myb−/− induces a more severe phenotypes suggesting a synergistic genetic interaction between c-myb and runx1 in neutrophil maturation. Further studies revealed that the two transcription factors act cooperatively to control neutrophil maturation processes via transactivating a series of neutrophil maturation-related genes. These data reveal the in vivo roles of Runx1 in regulating primitive neutrophil maturation while also indicating a novel genetic and molecular orchestration of Runx1 and c-Myb in myeloid cell development. The study will provide new evidence on the regulation of neutrophil maturation during hematopoiesis.},

FOXC1 stabilizes association of RUNX1, HDAC1, and Groucho repressor TLE3 to limit enhancer activity: FOXC1 knockdown induces loss of repressor proteins, gain of CEBPA binding, enhancer acetylation, and upregulation of nearby genes, including KLF2. Furthermore, it triggers genome-wide redistribution of RUNX1, TLE3, and HDAC1 from enhancers to promoters, leading to repression of self-renewal genes, including MYC and MYB. Our studies highlight RUNX1 and CEBPA transcription factor swapping as a feature of leukemia cell differentiation and reveal that FOXC1 prevents this by stabilizing enhancer binding of a RUNX1/HDAC1/TLE3 transcription repressor complex to oncogenic effect.},

In vitro studies and findings in human diseases, including leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggest that AML-1 has a pivotal role in adult hematopoiesis. However, this role has not been fully uncovered in vivo because of the embryonic lethality of Runx1 knockout in mice. Here we assess the requirement of AML-1/Runx1 in adult hematopoiesis using an inducible gene-targeting method. In the absence of AML-1, hematopoietic progenitors were fully maintained with normal myeloid cell development. However, AML-1-deficient bone marrow showed inhibition of megakaryocytic maturation, increased hematopoietic progenitor cells and defective T- and B-lymphocyte development. AML-1 is thus required for maturation of megakaryocytes and differentiation of T and B cells, but not for maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in adult hematopoiesis.},

In light of recent reports of disparate requirements for hematopoietic transcription factors during development as opposed to adult hematopoiesis, we used a conditional gene-targeting strategy to effect the loss of Runx1 function in adult mice. In contrast with the critical role of Runx1 during development, Runx1 was not essential for hematopoiesis in the adult hematopoietic compartment, though a number of significant hematopoietic abnormalities were observed. Runx1 excision had lineage-specific effects on B- and T-cell maturation and pronounced inhibition of common lymphocyte progenitor production. Runx1 excision also resulted in inefficient platelet production. Of note, Runx1-deficient mice developed a mild myeloproliferative phenotype characterized by an increase in peripheral blood neutrophils, an increase in myeloid progenitor populations, and extramedullary hematopoiesis composed of maturing myeloid and erythroid elements. These findings indicate that Runx1 deficiency has markedly different consequences during development compared with adult hematopoiesis, and they provide insight into the phenotypic manifestations of Runx1 deficiency in hematopoietic malignancies.},

The LIM-homeobox genes are known to be important for asymmetric cell divisions and differentiation of specific cell types and organs. One member of this family, LH2, is expressed in fetal liver at the time of active hematopoiesis. Therefore, we have assessed the function of LH2 during the formation and initial expansion of the hematopoietic system by differentiating LH2-transduced embryonic stem (ES) cells in vitro. This procedure generated multipotent hematopoietic precursor cell (HPC) lines that required Steel factor for growth. HPC lines have been maintained in an undifferentiated state in culture for {\textgreater}7 months. Other growth factors tested efficiently induce terminal differentiation of HPCs into various mature myeloid lineages. Steel factor is also required and acts synergistically with the other growth factors to generate multilineage colonies from the HPCs. These HPC lines express transcription factors that are consistent with an immature progenitor, and the pattern of cell surface marker expression is similar to that of early fetal multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. Collectively, these data suggest that the HPC lines represent an early fetal multipotent hematopoietic progenitor, and suggest a role for LH2 in the control of cell fate decision and/or proliferation in the hematopoietic system.},

Modern sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to generate genome-scale expression and histone modification profiles, transcription factor (TF)-binding maps, and also comprehensive chromatin-looping information. Many of these technologies, however, require large numbers of cells, and therefore cannot be applied to rare hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) populations. The stem cell factor-dependent multipotent progenitor cell line HPC-7 represents a well-recognized cell line model for HSPCs. Here we report genome-wide maps for 17 TFs, 3 histone modifications, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and high-resolution promoter-enhancer interactomes in HPC-7 cells. Integrated analysis of these complementary data sets revealed TF occupancy patterns of genomic regions involved in promoter-anchored loops. Moreover, preferential associations between pairs of TFs bound at either ends of chromatin loops led to the identification of 4 previously unrecognized protein-protein interactions between key blood stem cell regulators. All HPC-7 data sets are freely available both through standard repositories and a user-friendly Web interface. Together with previously generated genome-wide data sets, this study integrates HPC-7 data into a genomic resource on par with ENCODE tier 1 cell lines and, importantly, is the only current model with comprehensive genome-scale data that is relevant to HSPC biology.},

To this end, we used an HSC cell-tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice, in a non-conditioned transplantation model, to assess divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency. Thus HSC fate decisions can be uncoupled from physical cell division. These results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells., Dependence of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate on the phase of the cell cycle has not been demonstrated in vivo.

Here, we show that MLL normally regulates expression of mir-196b, a hematopoietic microRNA located within the HoxA cluster, in a pattern similar to that of the surrounding 5′ Hox genes, Hoxa9 and Hoxa10, during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation. Within the hematopoietic lineage, mir-196b is most abundant in short-term hematopoietic stem cells and is down-regulated in more differentiated hematopoietic cells. Leukemogenic MLL fusion proteins cause overexpression of mir-196b, while treatment of MLL-AF9 transformed bone marrow cells with mir-196–specific antagomir abrogates their replating potential in methylcellulose. This demonstrates that mir-196b function is necessary for MLL fusion-mediated immortalization. Furthermore, overexpression of mir-196b was found specifically in patients with MLL associated leukemias as determined from analysis of 55 primary leukemia samples. Overexpression of mir-196b in bone marrow progenitor cells leads to increased proliferative capacity and survival, as well as a partial block in differentiation. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby increased expression of mir-196b by MLL fusion proteins significantly contributes to leukemia development.},

	abstract = {Although human cancers have complex genotypes and are genomically unstable, they often remain dependent on the continued presence of single-driver mutations—a phenomenon dubbed “oncogene addiction.” Such dependencies have been demonstrated in mouse models, where conditional expression systems have revealed that oncogenes able to initiate cancer are often required for tumor maintenance and progression, thus validating the pathways they control as therapeutic targets. Here, we implement an integrative approach that combines genetically defined mouse models, transcriptional profiling, and a novel inducible RNAi platform to characterize cellular programs that underlie addiction to MLL-AF9—a fusion oncoprotein involved in aggressive forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that MLL-AF9 contributes to leukemia maintenance by enforcing a Myb-coordinated program of aberrant self-renewal involving genes linked to leukemia stem cell potential and poor prognosis in human AML. Accordingly, partial and transient Myb suppression precisely phenocopies MLL-AF9 withdrawal and eradicates aggressive AML in vivo without preventing normal myelopoiesis, indicating that strategies to inhibit Myb-dependent aberrant self-renewal programs hold promise as effective and cancer-specific therapeutics. Together, our results identify Myb as a critical mediator of oncogene addiction in AML, delineate relevant Myb target genes that are amenable to pharmacologic inhibition, and establish a general approach for dissecting oncogene addiction in vivo.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}MYB is a DNA-binding transcription factor with a critical role in the establishment of definitive haematopoiesis. In haematological malignancies, MYB is a direct downstream target common to several MLL-fusion proteins (MLL-FP), including MLL-AF9, the most common MLL-FP in acute myeloid leukaemia. MYB is necessary for the maintenance of MLL-AF9 leukaemia, and even partial and transient loss of MYB has been shown to abrogate MLL-AF9 leukaemia in vivo. While MYB inhibition is able to attenuate leukaemogenesis, its specific requirement in the processes of leukaemia initiation and transformation is still unclear. Furthermore, despite its obvious importance in normal and malignant haematopoiesis, much is still unknown regarding its molecular function. Recent evidence from disease models suggests that MYB functions through establishing aberrant enhancer activity, however this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested. In this thesis, to investigate the requirement for MYB in leukaemia initiation, we engineered a conditional miRNA mediated Myb repression circuit in a mouse model system, which represses Myb only in the presence of the MLL-AF9 oncoprotein. Myb repression during leukaemia initiation was correlated with a trend in decreased clonogenic potential in vitro, as well as a convincing reduction in leukaemia fitness in vivo, suggesting that a threshold level of Myb is required to propagate an aggressive leukaemia phenotype. Using an artificial chromatin recruitment system, we demonstrated that the MYB transcriptional activation domain was sufficient to generate an enhancer-like element and induce transcription of distal sequences, suggesting that MYB may be competent to initiate enhancer activity in vivo. Further to this, weshowed that MYB dependent gene activation appears to be mediated through its maintenance of enhancer activity, as demonstrated by the loss of H3K27ac, enhancer RNA transcription and chromatin accessibility at the cognate intergenic enhancers of specific MYB sensitive genes with MYB knockdown. Importantly, we found that MYB dependent gene activation can be disrupted with minimal changes in enhancer-promoter interaction frequency, suggesting that these are functionally and temporally separable events. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator. Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation. Reduced levels of Oct4 or Mediator cause preferential loss of expression of super-enhancer-associated genes relative to other genes, suggesting how changes in gene expression programs might be accomplished during development.

	abstract = {In any given cell, thousands of genes are expressed and work in concert to ensure the cell's function, fitness, and survival. Each gene, in turn, must be expressed at the proper time and in the proper amounts to ensure the appropriate functional outcome. The regulation and expression of some genes are highly robust; their expression is controlled by invariable expression programs. For instance, developmental gene expression is extremely similar in a given cell type from one individual to another. The expression of other genes is more variable: Their levels are noisy and are different from cell to cell and from individual to individual. This can be highly beneficial in physiological responses to outside cues and stresses. Recent advances have enabled the analysis of differential gene expression at a systems level. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving interactions between large numbers of genes and their regulators have been mapped onto graphic diagrams that are used to visualize the regulatory relationships. The further characterization of GRNs has already uncovered global principles of gene regulation. Together with synthetic network biology, such studies are starting to provide insights into the transcriptional mechanisms that cause robust versus stochastic gene expression and their relationships to phenotypic robustness and variability. Here, we discuss GRNs and their topological properties in relation to transcriptional and phenotypic outputs in development and organismal physiology.},

	abstract = {SIP1/ZEB2 is a member of the deltaEF-1 family of two-handed zinc finger nuclear factors. The expression of these transcription factors is associated with epithelial mesenchymal transitions (EMT) during development. SIP1 is also expressed in some breast cancer cell lines and was detected in intestinal gastric carcinomas, where its expression is inversely correlated with that of E-cadherin. Here, we show that expression of SIP1 in human epithelial cells results in a clear morphological change from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype. Induction of this epithelial dedifferentiation was accompanied by repression of several cell junctional proteins, with concomitant repression of their mRNA levels. Besides E-cadherin, other genes coding for crucial proteins of tight junctions, desmosomes and gap junctions were found to be transcriptionally regulated by the transcriptional repressor SIP1. Moreover, study of the promoter regions of selected genes by luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that repression is directly mediated by SIP1. These data indicate that, during epithelial dedifferentiation, SIP1 represses in a coordinated manner the transcription of genes coding for junctional proteins contributing to the dedifferentiated state; this repression occurs by a general mechanism mediated by Smad Interacting Protein 1 (SIP1)-binding sites.},

	abstract = {Human lymphopoiesis is a dynamic lifelong process that starts in utero 6 weeks postconception. Although fetal B-lymphopoiesis remains poorly defined, it is key to understanding leukemia initiation in early life. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the human fetal B-cell developmental hierarchy. We report the presence in fetal tissues of 2 distinct CD19+ B-progenitors, an adult-type CD10+ve ProB-progenitor and a new CD10-ve PreProB-progenitor, and describe their molecular and functional characteristics. PreProB-progenitors and ProB-progenitors appear early in the first trimester in embryonic liver, followed by a sustained second wave of B-progenitor development in fetal bone marrow (BM), where together they form {\textgreater}40\% of the total hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor pool. Almost one-third of fetal B-progenitors are CD10-ve PreProB-progenitors, whereas, by contrast, PreProB-progenitors are almost undetectable (0.53\% ± 0.24\%) in adult BM. Single-cell transcriptomics and functional assays place fetal PreProB-progenitors upstream of ProB-progenitors, identifying them as the first B-lymphoid-restricted progenitor in human fetal life. Although fetal BM PreProB-progenitors and ProB-progenitors both give rise solely to B-lineage cells, they are transcriptionally distinct. As with their fetal counterparts, adult BM PreProB-progenitors give rise only to B-lineage cells in vitro and express the expected B-lineage gene expression program. However, fetal PreProB-progenitors display a distinct, ontogeny-related gene expression pattern that is not seen in adult PreProB-progenitors, and they share transcriptomic signatures with CD10-ve B-progenitor infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia blast cells. These data identify PreProB-progenitors as the earliest B-lymphoid-restricted progenitor in human fetal life and suggest that this fetal-restricted committed B-progenitor might provide a permissive cellular context for prenatal B-progenitor leukemia initiation.},

        , The gene encoding the RUNX1 transcription factor is mutated in a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients, and RUNX1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis. These mutations cluster in the DNA-binding Runt domain and are thought to represent loss-of-function mutations, indicating that RUNX1 suppresses T-cell transformation. RUNX1 has been proposed to have tumor suppressor roles in T-cell leukemia homeobox 1/3–transformed human T-ALL cell lines and NOTCH1 T-ALL mouse models. Yet, retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens identify RUNX genes as collaborating oncogenes in MYC-driven leukemia mouse models. To elucidate RUNX1 function(s) in leukemogenesis, we generated Tal1/Lmo2/Rosa26-CreERT2Runx1f/f mice and examined leukemia progression in the presence of vehicle or tamoxifen. We found that Runx1 deletion inhibits mouse leukemic growth in vivo and that RUNX silencing in human T-ALL cells triggers apoptosis. We demonstrate that a small molecule inhibitor, designed to interfere with CBFβ binding to RUNX proteins, impairs the growth of human T-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples. We demonstrate that a RUNX1 deficiency alters the expression of a crucial subset of TAL1- and NOTCH1-regulated genes, including the MYB and MYC oncogenes, respectively. These studies provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that RUNX1 has oncogenic roles and reveal RUNX1 as a novel therapeutic target in T-ALL.},

Background:
MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is prevalent in infants, constituting 70\% of the cases. The preferred MLL translocation partner is the gene AF4, resulting in t(4;11)(q21;q23), which arises in 50\% of infant ALL patients. This translocation generates the fusion genes MLL/AF4 and AF4/MLL, and is associated with an aggressive clinical presentation and poor outcome. Biologically, cells expressing MLL/AF4 show resistance to stress- and chemotherapy-related apoptosis. Concordantly, we have previously shown that RNAi-mediated depletion of MLL/AF4 in the t(4;11)-positive ALL cell line SEM results in induction of cell death and impaired both clonogenicity and in vivo engraftment. In order to characterize this phenotype on a molecular level, we have performed gene expression profiling of SEM cells depleted of MLL/AF4 and corresponding controls. Expression of {\textgreater}1000 genes was affected, including a subset of angiogenic genes, most prominently ANGIOPOIETIN1 (ANGPT1), a proangiogenic cytokine reported to play a role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and bone marrow (BM) niche maintenance, but to date not implicated in ALL. Here we report a novel link between ANGPT1 expression and MLL-rearranged ALL.
Methods:
Gene expression profiling was performed using the Illumina HT-12 platform and data processed using BeadStudio and Genespring software suites. ANGPT1 expression was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and ANGPT1 protein secretion determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The MLL/AF4 status of cells was modulated with fusion transcript-specific siRNAs and knockdown monitored by qRT-PCR. RNAi-mediated depletion of ANGPT1 was achieved using siRNA or lentiviral shRNA constructs, and validated on transcript and protein level. Effects on cell cycle progression and proliferation in response to ANGPT1 knockdown in t(4;11)-positive cells were assessed by flow cytometry and trypan blue exclusion assay, respectively. For in vivo studies, SEM cells were sequentially transduced to express both luciferase and either non-target control shRNA (shNTC) or shANGPT1. Doubly transduced cells were selected for and FACS-sorted prior to intrafemoral transplantation into immunodeficient NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Disease progression was monitored using bioluminescence imaging and engraftment assessed by flow cytometry at the terminal timepoint.
Results:
ANGPT1 expression was screened in a MLL-rearranged ALL patient cohort (n=35), comprising t(4;11)-positive (n=20), t(11;19)-positive (n=10) and t(9;11)-positive patients (n=5), and in a MLL-wildtype BCP ALL patient cohort (n=8). MLL-rearranged patients showed ANGPT1 upregulation, t(4;11)-positive patients having the strongest overexpression by 232-fold when compared to ANGPT1 levels in CD19+ peripheral blood (PB) cells. A 27-fold and 13-fold upregulation was detected in t(11;19)- and t(9;11)-positive patients, respectively. Conversely, MLL-wildtype BCP ALL patients had similar ANGPT1 levels as CD19+ PB cells, with only a 2-fold increase. In addition to its high expression in t(4;11)-positive ALL, ANGPT1 levels were shown to be dependent on MLL/AF4; a reduction of ANGPT1 mRNA and protein correlated with siRNA-mediated MLL/AF4 depletion in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines and primary patient samples. This was concordant with expression array data, which indicated an up to 4-fold decrease of ANGPT1 in response to MLL/AF4 depletion. The functional role of ANGPT1 in t(4;11)-positive ALL was assessed by RNAi; sustained depletion of ANGPT1 in SEM cells resulted in cell cycle arrest and a marked decrease in proliferation. In vivo, mice transplanted with shANGPT1 expressing SEM cells showed reduced splenic infiltration and development of solid tumours at the injection site, as opposed to a systemic spread of the disease and massive splenomegaly in mice injected with shNTC expressing SEM cells.
Conclusions:
In this study we have identified ANGPT1 as a novel player in t(4;11)-positive ALL, as defined by overexpression, MLL/AF4-dependent regulation and functional consequences in vivo and in vitro. Currently we are investigating ANGPT1-mediated signalling in t(4;11) ALL cells, as it represents an attractive potential therapeutic target.

	abstract = {Leukemic cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants are frequently characterised by chromosome translocations involving 11q23, resulting in the rearrangement of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene and subsequent generation of MLL fusion gene. Among more than 50 genes which have been identified as the fusion partner of the MLL gene, fusion with AF4 is characteristically observed in infant ALL representing a hallmark of poor prognosis. Although recent progress of intensive chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation has improved its treatment outcome, the treatment is often accompanied by long-term side effects. Less toxic molecular targeting therapies are therefore necessary for infant ALL.We have previously reported that in infant ALL with MLL fusion gene, microRNA let-7b is significantly downregulated by DNA hypermethylation of its promoter region. The downregulation of let-7b is one of the consequences of oncogenic MLL fusion proteins contributing to leukemogenesis possibly through upregulation of let-7b-regulated target genes with oncogenic potential such as high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2). HMGA2 is a chromatin-remodelling factor, which alters chromatin architecture by binding to AT-rich regions in the DNA, either promoting or inhibiting the expression of its target genes. One of the targets of HMGA2 is CDKN2A gene which encodes 2 cell cycle regulators p16INK4A and p14ARF. This let-7b-HMGA2-CDKN2A axis regulates cellular growth and senescence of stem cells both in normal and pathological state such as cancer.We initially examined the expression of HMGA2 in leukemic cells obtained from 35 MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients (MLL-AF4, n = 26; MLL-AF9, n = 4; MLL-ENL, n = 5) using quantitative RT-PCR. As results, HMGA2 was highly expressed in most of the patients with MLL fusion gene, especially in MLL-AF4-positive cases, compared to those without the fusion. These results indicate that deregulation of let-7b-HMGA2 axis by MLL fusion may contribute to leukemogenesis and could be a possible target of molecular therapy against MLL-rearranged ALL.As let-7b is downregulated by promoter hypermethylation, demethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine could be applied to recover the expression of the gene in leukemic cells with MLL fusion gene. To test this possibility, leukemic cell lines with MLL-AF4 fusion gene were used. The administration of 5-azacytidine alone was able to restore the expression of suppressed let-7b as well as p16INK4A gene in the leukemic cells, but the effects was incomplete, showing persistent partial promoter methylation. In addition, the recovered expression disappeared when 5-azacytidine was removed. On the other hand, when HMGA2 inhibitor was combined with 5-azacytidine, the expression of let-7b was upregulated and sustained resulting in suppression of HMGA2 protein itself. This upregulation of let-7b and suppression of HMGA2 protein persisted even after the removal of 5-azacytidine, possibly through maintaining of the demethylating status by HMGA2 inhibitor. Inhibition of HMGA2 by either siRNA or HMGA2 inhibitor suppressed the growth of MLL-AF4-positive leukemic cells when analysed by MTT assay. The effects of HMGA2 inhibitor on cell growth inhibition became more prominent in combination with demethylating agent 5-azacytidine.Our results revealed the functional significance of let-7b and HMGA2 in controlling MLL-AF4-positive leukemic cell growth and the therapeutic potential of combining demethylating agent and the HMGA2 inhibitor in the treatment of MLL-AF4-positive ALL.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

A new study in this issue describes how the C/EBPα transcription factor is crucial for the initiation of AML induced by MLL fusion oncoproteins, but is entirely dispensable for the maintenance of established disease.

Understanding gene function and genetic relationships is fundamental to our efforts to better understand biological systems. Previous studies systematically describing genetic interactions on a global scale have either focused on core biological processes in protozoans or surveyed catastrophic interactions in metazoans. Here, we describe a reliable high-throughput approach capable of revealing both weak and strong genetic interactions in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

Results
We investigated interactions between 11 'query' mutants in conserved signal transduction pathways and hundreds of 'target' genes compromised by RNA interference (RNAi). Mutant-RNAi combinations that grew more slowly than controls were identified, and genetic interactions inferred through an unbiased global analysis of the interaction matrix. A network of 1,246 interactions was uncovered, establishing the largest metazoan genetic-interaction network to date. We refer to this approach as systematic genetic interaction analysis (SGI). To investigate how genetic interactions connect genes on a global scale, we superimposed the SGI network on existing networks of physical, genetic, phenotypic and coexpression interactions. We identified 56 putative functional modules within the superimposed network, one of which regulates fat accumulation and is coordinated by interactions with bar-1(ga80), which encodes a homolog of β-catenin. We also discovered that SGI interactions link distinct subnetworks on a global scale. Finally, we showed that the properties of genetic networks are conserved between C. elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but that the connectivity of interactions within the current networks is not.

Conclusions
Synthetic genetic interactions may reveal redundancy among functional modules on a global scale, which is a previously unappreciated level of organization within metazoan systems. Although the buffering between functional modules may differ between species, studying these differences may provide insight into the evolution of divergent form and function.},

Therefore, a protein's position in a network may indicate how central it is to cellular function and, hence, how constrained it is evolutionarily. To look for an effect of position on evolutionary rate, we examined the protein-protein interaction networks in three eukaryotes: yeast, worm, and fly. We find that the three networks have remarkably similar structure, such that the number of interactors per protein and the centrality of proteins in the networks have similar distributions. Proteins that have a more central position in all three networks, regardless of the number of direct interactors, evolve more slowly and are more likely to be essential for survival. Our results are thus consistent with a classic proposal of Fisher's that pleiotropy constrains evolution.},

The in situ localization of Runx and Smad proteins must impact the mechanisms by which these proteins function together in gene regulation. We show that the integration of Runx and Smad signals is mediated by in situ interactions at specific foci within the nucleus. Activated Smads are directed to these subnuclear foci only in the presence of Runx proteins. Smad–Runx complexes are associated in situ with the nuclear matrix, and this association requires the intranuclear targeting signal of Runx factors. The convergence of Smad and Runx proteins at these sites supports transcription as reflected by BrUTP labeling and functional cooperativity between the proteins. Thus, Runx-mediated intranuclear targeting of Smads is critical for the integration of two distinct pathways essential for fetal development.},

Here, we adapted a single-cell expression profiling technique to examine the gene expression program downstream of Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors during 3D breast epithelial acinar morphogenesis. By analyzing patterns of mRNA fluctuations among individual matrix-attached epithelial cells, we found that a subset of FOXO target genes was jointly regulated by the transcription factor Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1). Knockdown of RUNX1 causes hyperproliferation and abnormal morphogenesis, both of which require normal FOXO function. Down-regulating RUNX1 and FOXOs simultaneously causes widespread oxidative stress, which arrests proliferation and restores normal acinar morphology. In hormone-negative breast cancers lacking human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification, we find that RUNX1 down-regulation is strongly associated with up-regulation of FOXO1, which may be required to support growth of RUNX1-negative tumors. The coordinate function of these two tumor suppressors may provide a failsafe mechanism that inhibits cancer progression.},

The WRC is inactive toward the Arp2/3 complex, but can be stimulated by the Rac GTPase, kinases and phosphatidylinositols. We report the 2.3 Å crystal structure of the WRC and complementary mechanistic analyses. The structure shows that the activity-bearing VCA motif of WAVE is sequestered by a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular contacts within the WRC. Rac and kinases appear to destabilize a WRC element that is necessary for VCA sequestration, suggesting how these signals stimulate WRC activity toward the Arp2/3 complex.

However, the molecular mechanism of microvascular angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. Through studying Borg5 (Binder of the Rho GTPase 5), which belongs to a family of poorly understood effector proteins of the Cdc42 GTPase, we uncover a role for Borg5 in microvascular angiogenesis. Deletion of Borg5 in mice results in defects in retinal and cardiac microvasculature as well as heart development. Borg5 promotes angiogenesis by regulating persistent directional migration of the endothelial cells (ECs). In primary mouse cardiac ECs (MCECs), Borg5 associates with septins in the perinuclear region and colocalizes with actomyosin fibers. Both Borg5 deletion and septin 7 knockdown lead to a disruption of the perinuclear actomyosin and persistent directional migration.

	abstract = {Background
The Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C-kinase Substrate (MARCKS) and MARCKS-like protein 1 (MARCKSL1) have a wide range of functions, ranging from roles in embryonic development to adult brain plasticity and the inflammatory response. Recently, both proteins have also been identified as important players in regeneration. Upon phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding, MARCKS and MARCKSL1 translocate from the membrane into the cytosol, modulating cytoskeletal actin dynamics and vesicular trafficking and activating various signal transduction pathways. As a consequence, the two proteins are involved in the regulation of cell migration, secretion, proliferation and differentiation in many different tissues.

Main body
Throughout vertebrate development, MARCKS and MARCKSL1 are widely expressed in tissues derived from all germ layers, with particularly strong expression in the nervous system. They have been implicated in the regulation of gastrulation, myogenesis, brain development, and other developmental processes. Mice carrying loss of function mutations in either Marcks or Marcksl1 genes die shortly after birth due to multiple deficiencies including detrimental neural tube closure defects. In adult vertebrates, MARCKS and MARCKL1 continue to be important for multiple regenerative processes including peripheral nerve, appendage, and tail regeneration, making them promising targets for regenerative medicine.

Conclusion
This review briefly summarizes the molecular interactions and cellular functions of MARCKS and MARCKSL1 proteins and outlines their vital roles in development and regeneration.},

Disruption of cooperative gene activation could contribute to aberrant repression of differentiation genes and leukemogenesis initiated by mutations and translocations of RUNX1. To investigate the mechanisms underlying cooperative gene activation, the effects of Runx1 deficiency were examined in an in vitro model of Pu.1-driven macrophage differentiation and in primary cells. Runx1 deficiency decreased Pu.1-mediated activation of Mcsfr and Gmcsfr, accompanied by decreased histone acetylation at the Mcsfr and Gmcsfr promoters, and increased endogenous corepressor (Eto2, Sin3A, and Hdac2) coimmunoprecipitation with Pu.1. In cotransfection experiments, corepressors were excluded from a multiprotein complex containing full-length RUNX1 and PU.1. However, corepressors interacted with PU.1 if wild-type RUNX1 was replaced with truncated variants associated with leukemia. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme activity is a major component of corepressor function. HDAC inhibition using suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or MS-275 significantly increased MCSFR and GMCSFR expression in leukemia cell lines that express PU.1 and mutated or translocated RUNX1. RUNX1 deficiency is associated with persistent corepressor interaction with PU.1. Thus, inhibiting HDAC can partly compensate for the functional consequences of RUNX1 deficiency.},

These include the exon VII domain for Ets-1 and the negative regulatory domain for DNA binding (NRDB) for alphaB1. Here we report that the direct interaction between the two factors leads to a reciprocal stimulation of their DNA binding activity and activation of their transactivation function. Detailed mapping revealed two independent contact points involving the exon VII and NRDB regions as well as the two DNA binding domains. Using deletion variants and dominant interfering mutants, we demonstrate that the interaction between exon VII and NRDB is necessary and sufficient for cooperative DNA binding. The exon VII and NRDB motifs are highly conserved in evolution yet deleted in natural variants, suggesting that the mechanism described is of biological relevance. The mutual activation of DNA binding of Ets and AML1 through the intermolecular interaction of autoinhibitory domains may represent a novel principle for the regulation of transcription factor function.},

We have previously demonstrated an HSC-supportive function for GATA3 within the sympathetic nervous system and the sub-aortic mesenchyme, but show here that it also plays a cell-intrinsic role during the EHT. It is expressed in hemogenic endothelial cells and early HSC precursors, where its expression correlates with a more quiescent state. Importantly, endothelial-specific deletion of Gata3 shows that it is functionally required for these cells to mature into HSCs, placing GATA3 at the core of the EHT regulatory network.},

              GLI3 is silenced in AML, and decitabine restores GLI3 expression and leads to modulation of Hh signaling.
            
          
        , The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is activated in many cancers and is a promising target for therapeutic development. Deletions in the receptor Patched (PTCH) or activating mutations in Smoothened (SMO) have been reported in basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but are largely absent in most tumor types. Therefore, the mechanism of pathway activation in most cancers, including hematological malignancies, remains unknown. In normal tissues, Hh pathway activation via PTCH/SMO causes an increase in the downstream transcriptional activator GLI1 and a decrease in the GLI3 transcriptional repressor (GLI3R). In this article, we confirm that the Hh pathway is active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, this activity is largely independent of SMO. Epigenetic and gene expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas AML data set reveals that GLI3 expression is silenced in most AML patient samples, and the GLI3 locus is abnormally methylated. We show that GLI3R is required for the therapeutic effect of SMO antagonists in AML samples and restoration of GLI3R suppresses the growth of AML. We additionally demonstrate that GLI3R represses AML growth by downregulating AKT expression. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that GLI3R plays an essential role in SMO-independent Hh signaling in AML, and suggests that GLI3R could serve as a potential biomarker for patient selection in SMO antagonist clinical trials. Furthermore, these data support rational combinations of hypomethylating agents with SMO antagonists in clinical trials.},

We also cloned and sequenced the cDNA of its murine homologue (MMU-TUBA8). The latter encodes for a protein that differs from its human counterpart in only three amino acids, revealing an extreme rate of conservation that is even extended to both the 3' and 5' UTRs of the mRNAs. Sequence comparison of these novel isoforms with other known alpha tubulins shows that tuba8 is the most divergent member of the mammalian alpha-tubulin family.

MLL-AF9 transduced single HSC or GMP could be continuously replated, but HSC-derived clones were more likely than GMP-derived clones to initiate AML in mice. Leukemia stem cells derived from either HSC or GMP had a similar immunophenotype consistent with a maturing myeloid cell (LGMP). Gene expression analyses demonstrated that LGMP inherited gene expression programs from the cell of origin including high-level Evi-1 expression in HSC derived LGMP. The gene expression signature of LGMP derived from HSC was enriched in poor prognosis human MLL-rearranged AML in three independent data sets. Moreover, global 5’-mC levels were elevated in HSC-derived leukemias as compared to GMP-derived leukemias. This mirrored a difference seen in 5-mC between MLL-rearranged human leukemias that are either EVI1-positive or EVI1-negative. Finally, HSC derived leukemias were more resistant to chemotherapy than GMP-derived leukemias. These data demonstrate that the cell of origin influences the gene expression profile, the epigenetic state, and the drug response in AML, and that these differences can account for clinical heterogeneity within a molecularly defined group of leukemias.},

To establish tissue-specific expression, Maf binds to Maf-recognition elements (MAREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes, and functionally interacts with other transcription factors. For example, L-Maf and c-Maf, which are specifically expressed in developing lens cells, act synergistically with Sox proteins to induce lens-specific crystalline genes. MafA, a β-cell-specific member of the Maf family, activates the insulin gene promoter synergistically with Pdx1 and Beta2 to establish β-cell specific expression. Furthermore, in β-cells, MafA activity is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels by glucose and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the functions and roles of Maf in various biological processes and recent progress in elucidating the mechanisms whereby Maf proteins regulate transcription.},

Because CNC and Bach proteins cannot bind to DNA as monomers, sMafs are indispensable partners that are required by CNC and Bach proteins to exert their functions. sMafs lack the transcriptional activation domain; hence, their homodimers act as transcriptional repressors. In contrast, sMafs participate in transcriptional activation or repression depending on their heterodimeric partner molecules and context. Mouse genetic analyses have revealed that various biological pathways are under the regulation of CNC-sMaf heterodimers. In this review, we summarize the history and current progress of sMaf studies in relation to their partners.},

Co-operative recognition of DNA by multiple TFs allows both definition of unique genomic positions in large genomes, and complex information processing at the level of individual regulatory elements. The TFs can co-operate in multiple different ways, and the precise mechanism used for co-operation determines important features of the regulatory interactions. Here, we present an overview of the structural basis of the different mechanisms by which TFs can cooperate, focusing on insight from recent functional studies and structural analyses of specific TF–TF–DNA complexes.},

Thus, Notch target genes must be efficiently silenced in cells where Notch activity is no longer required. How these genes are repressed remains poorly understood. We report here that the Ikaros transcription factor plays a crucial role in repressing the transcriptional response to Notch signaling in T-cell development. Using the Notch target gene Hes-1 as a model, we show that Ikaros and RBP-Jκ, the transcriptional mediator of Notch signaling, compete for binding to two elements in the Hes-1 promoter in immature thymocytes. This antagonistic interaction likely occurs at the CD4− CD8− CD3− double-negative 4 (DN4) stage, where Ikaros levels and binding to the Hes-1 promoter increase sharply and wild-type thymocytes lose their capacity to transcribe Hes-1 upon Notch stimulation. Nonresponsiveness to Notch signaling requires Ikaros, as Ikaros-deficient DN4 and CD4+ CD8+ double-positive (DP) cells remain competent to express Hes-1 after Notch activation. Further, Hes-1 promoter sequences from Ikaros-deficient DP cells show reduced trimethylated H3K27, a modification associated with silent chromatin. These results indicate that Ikaros functions as a transcriptional checkpoint to repress Notch target gene expression in T cells.},

The mechanisms by which haematopoiesis is restricted to this domain, and how the morphological transformation from endothelial to haematopoietic is controlled are unknown. We show here that HoxA3, a gene uniquely expressed in the embryonic but not yolk sac vasculature, restrains haematopoietic differentiation of the earliest endothelial progenitors, and induces reversion of the earliest haematopoietic progenitors into CD41-negative endothelial cells. This reversible modulation of endothelial-haematopoietic state is accomplished by targeting key haematopoietic transcription factors for downregulation, including Runx1, Gata1, Gfi1B, Ikaros, and PU.1. Through loss-of-function, and gain-of-function epistasis experiments, and the identification of antipodally regulated targets, we show that among these factors, Runx1 is uniquely able to erase the endothelial program set up by HoxA3. These results suggest both why a frank endothelium does not precede haematopoiesis in the yolk sac, and why haematopoietic stem cell generation requires Runx1 expression only in endothelial cells.},

Here we show that during pre-B-cell-to-macrophage transdifferentiation, C/EBPα binds to two types of myeloid enhancers in B cells: pre-existing enhancers that are bound by PU.1, providing a platform for incoming C/EBPα; and de novo enhancers that are targeted by C/EBPα, acting as a pioneer factor for subsequent binding by PU.1. The order of factor binding dictates the upregulation kinetics of nearby genes. Pre-existing enhancers are broadly active throughout the hematopoietic lineage tree, including B cells. In contrast, de novo enhancers are silent in most cell types except in myeloid cells where they become activated by C/EBP factors. Our data suggest that C/EBPα recapitulates physiological developmental processes by short-circuiting two macrophage enhancer pathways in pre-B cells.},

A paucity of functional data led us to investigate the role of super-enhancers in the mammary gland, an organ characterized by exceptional gene regulatory dynamics during pregnancy. ChIP-seq analysis for the master regulator STAT5A, the glucocorticoid receptor, H3K27ac and MED1 identified 440 mammary-specific super-enhancers, half of which were associated with genes activated during pregnancy. We interrogated the Wap super-enhancer, generating mice carrying mutations in STAT5-binding sites within its constituent enhancers. Individually, the most distal site displayed the greatest enhancer activity. However, combinatorial mutation analysis showed that the 1,000-fold induction in gene expression during pregnancy relied on all enhancers. Disabling the binding sites of STAT5, NFIB and ELF5 in the proximal enhancer incapacitated the entire super-enhancer. Altogether, these data suggest a temporal and functional enhancer hierarchy. The identification of mammary-specific super-enhancers and the mechanistic exploration of the Wap locus provide insights into the regulation of cell-type-specific expression of hormone-sensing genes.},

Here we demonstrate that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is required for HSPC specification and that it regulates the expression of the Notch ligand Jagged1a in endothelial cells prior to EHT, in a striking parallel with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The requirement for TGFβ is two fold and sequential: autocrine via Tgfβ1a and Tgfβ1b produced in the endothelial cells themselves, followed by a paracrine input of Tgfβ3 from the notochord, suggesting that the former programs the hemogenic endothelium and the latter drives EHT.

As TGFβ signalling triggers a similar event during embryonic development called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), we hypothesised that TGFβ activity could play a similar role in EHT as well. We used the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation system for in vitro recapitulation of EHT and performed gain and loss of function analyses of the TGFβ pathway. Quantitative proteomics analysis showed that TGFβ treatment during EHT increased the secretion of several proteins linked to the vascular lineage. Live cell imaging showed that TGFβ blocked the formation of round blood cells. Using gene expression profiling we demonstrated that the TGFβ signalling activation decreased haematopoietic genes expression and increased the transcription of endothelial and extracellular matrix genes as well as EMT markers. Finally we found that the expression of the transcription factor Sox17 was up-regulated upon TGFβ signalling activation and showed that its overexpression was enough to block blood cell formation. In conclusion we showed that triggering the TGFβ pathway does not enhance EHT as we hypothesised but instead impairs it.},

	abstract = {The oncogenic ETS transcription factor ERG is involved in various cellular pathways including developmental regulation, proliferation, and differentiation. In hematopoiesis ERG plays a specific role during normal T-cell differentiation showing high expression levels in stem cells and down regulation in the progenitor compartment. In this regard, it is intriguing that aberrant expression of ERG was found in a subset of patients with acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and was associated with an inferior outcome. Furthermore, high level ERG expression was of adverse prognostic significance in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), thus highlighting ERG's potential role in myeloid as well as T-lineage leukemogenesis. ERG3 (NM\_182918) and ERG2 (NM\_004449) represent the main isoforms and show abundant expression in myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic progenitor cells. The expression pattern of specific ERG isoforms in acute leukemias has yet to be investigated. To further elucidate the nature of aberrant ERG expression we have determined the existence and transcriptional regulation of ERG isoforms in pretreatment bone marrow samples of adult T-ALL (n=21) and AML (n=20) patients as well as in normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells of healthy volunteers (n=5). 5′RACE revealed the presence of a new ERG isoform (ERG3Δex12) characterized by expression of exon 5 and absence of exon 12. Expression of ERG3Δex12 was verified by RT-PCR in AML, T-ALL, and CD34+ cells. In addition, real-time RT-PCR showed concomitant expression of the two main isoforms ERG2 and ERG3 in AML and normal CD34+ cells. In contrast, T-ALL patients lacked expression of ERG isoforms harboring exon 4 (ERG2). Promoter analyses of ERG2 and ERG3 revealed the presence of two CpG islands in the ERG2 promoter region, whereas no CpG island was predicted in the ERG3 promoter. Bisulfit conversion of genomic DNA and sequencing of cloned PCR products revealed a significantly higher degree of methylation of CpG island 2 in T-ALL samples (median: 86.4\%, range: 16.0 – 98.8\%) as compared to AML (median: 38.1\%, range: 10.9 – 60.7\%; P-value=0.0002 - two sided T-test). As for CpG island 1, CD34+ cells had the lowest rate of methylation in CpG island 2 (median: 7.7\%, range: 2.4 – 20.7\%). Thus, the differential expression of ERG isoforms is mediated by epigenetic silencing of exon 4 containing transcripts in T-ALL. In conclusion, the identification of the new ERG isoform (ERG3Δex12) suggests the association with different partners as the central exons, including exon 12, guide the interaction with different proteins. Furthermore, the distinct expression of specific ERG transcripts controlled by methylation adds to the complexity of ERG directed downstream pathways in different leukemic subtypes.},

	abstract = {The Ets-related gene (ERG) located on human chromosome 21 encodes a transcription factor and is thought to be causally related to Down syndrome–associated acute megakaryocytic leukemia in childhood. In clinical adult leukemia, however, increased expression of ERG is indicative of poor prognosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia, although the involvement of ERG in the development of adult leukemia remains elusive. Here, we show that forced expression of ERG in adult BM cells alters differentiation and induces expansion of T and erythroid cells and increases frequencies of myeloid progenitors in mouse BM transplantation models. The expanded T cells then develop T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after acquisition of mutations in the Notch1 gene. Targeted expression of ERG into B cells also altered differentiation and promoted growth of precursor B cells. Overall, these findings suggest a general role of ERG in promoting growth of adult hematopoietic cells in various lineages. In line with this, shRNA-mediated silencing of ERG expression attenuated growth of human leukemia cell lines of various lineages. Thus, ERG is capable of promoting the development of leukemia and is crucial for its maintenance.},

We find that ERG-deficient B lineage cells exhibit an early developmental block at the pre-B cell stage and proliferate less. The cells fail to express the immunoglobulin heavy chain due to inefficient V-to-DJ recombination, and cells that undergo recombination display a strong bias against incorporation of distal V gene segments. Furthermore, antisense transcription at PAX5-activated intergenic repeat (PAIR) elements, located in the distal region of the Igh locus, depends on ERG.

Pax5-deficient pro-B cells are, however, not yet committed to the B-lymphoid lineage, but instead have a broad lymphomyeloid developmental potential. Pax5 appears to mediate B-lineage commitment by repressing the transcription of non-B-lymphoid genes and by simultaneously activating the expression of B-lineage-specific genes. Pax5 thus functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator, depending on its interactions with corepressors of the Groucho protein family or with positive regulators such as the TATA-binding protein.

The MPO/HOCl system plays an important role in microbial killing by neutrophils. In addition, MPO has been demonstrated to be a local mediator of tissue damage and the resulting inflammation in various inflammatory diseases. These findings have implicated MPO as an important therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. In contrast to its injurious effects at sites of inflammation, recent studies using animal models of various inflammatory diseases have demonstrated that MPO deficiency results in the exaggeration of inflammatory response, and that it affects neutrophil functions including cytokine production. Given these diverse effects, a growing interest has emerged in the role of this well-studied enzyme in health and disease.},

	abstract = {GATA2 plays a crucial role for the mast cell fate decision. We herein demonstrate that GATA2 is also required for the maintenance of the cellular identity in committed mast cells derived from mouse bone marrow (BMMCs). The deletion of the GATA2 DNA binding domain (GATA2ΔCF) in BMMCs resulted in a loss of the mast cell phenotype and an increase in the number of CD11b- and/or Ly6G/C-positive cells. These cells showed the ability to differentiate into macrophage- and neutrophil-like cells but not into eosinophils. Although the mRNA levels of basophil-specific genes were elevated, CD49b, a representative basophil marker, never appeared on these cells. GATA2 ablation led to a significant upregulation of C/EBPα, and forced expression of C/EBPα in wild-type BMMCs phenocopied the GATA2ΔCF cells. Interestingly, simultaneous deletion of the Gata2 and Cebpa genes in BMMCs restored the aberrant increases of CD11b and Ly6G/C while retaining the reduced c-Kit expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that GATA2 directly binds to the +37-kb region of the Cebpa gene and thereby inhibits the RUNX1 and PU.1 binding to the neighboring region. Upregulation of C/EBPα following the loss of GATA2 was not observed in cultured mast cells derived from peritoneal fluid, whereas the repression of c-Kit and other mast cell-specific genes were observed in these cells. Collectively, these results indicate that GATA2 maintains cellular identity by preventing Cebpa gene activation in a subpopulation of mast cells, whereas it plays a fundamental role as a positive regulator of mast cell-specific genes throughout development of this cell lineage.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain blood cell homeostasis throughout life and can regenerate all blood lineages after transplantation. Despite this clear functional definition, highly enriched isolation of human HSCs can currently only be achieved through combinatorial assessment of multiple surface antigens. Although several transgenic HSC reporter mouse strains have been described, no analogous approach to prospectively isolate human HSCs has been reported. To identify genes with the most selective expression in human HSCs, we profiled population and single-cell transcriptomes of unexpanded and ex vivo cultured cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as well as peripheral blood, adult bone marrow, and fetal liver. On the basis of these analyses, we propose the master transcription factor HLF (hepatic leukemia factor) as one of the most specific HSC marker genes. To directly track its expression in human hematopoietic cells, we developed a genomic HLF reporter strategy, capable of selectively labeling the most immature blood cells on the basis of a single engineered parameter. Most importantly, HLF-expressing cells comprise all stem cell activity in culture and in vivo during serial transplantation. Taken together, these results experimentally establish HLF as a defining gene of the human HSC state and outline a new approach to continuously mark these cells with high fidelity.},

To unravel how the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment changes during human ontogeny and the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms, we compare 57,489 HSPCs from 5 different tissues spanning 4 developmental stages through the human lifetime. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies significant site- and developmental stage-specific transitions in cellular architecture and gene regulatory networks. Hematopoietic stem cells show progression from cycling to quiescence and increased inflammatory signaling during ontogeny. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset for understanding aberrant hematopoiesis through comparison to two cancers that present at distinct time points in postnatal life-juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, a childhood cancer, and myelofibrosis, which classically presents in older adults.},

Here we detail the development of FBM, including stroma, using multi-omic assessment of mRNA and multiplexed protein epitope expression. We find that the full blood and immune cell repertoire is established in FBM in a short time window of 6-7 weeks early in the second trimester. FBM promotes rapid and extensive diversification of myeloid cells, with granulocytes, eosinophils and dendritic cell subsets emerging for the first time. The substantial expansion of B lymphocytes in FBM contrasts with fetal liver at the same gestational age. Haematopoietic progenitors from fetal liver, FBM and cord blood exhibit transcriptional and functional differences that contribute to tissue-specific identity and cellular diversification. Endothelial cell types form distinct vascular structures that we show are regionally compartmentalized within FBM. Finally, we reveal selective disruption of B lymphocyte, erythroid and myeloid development owing to a cell-intrinsic differentiation bias as well as extrinsic regulation through an altered microenvironment in Down syndrome (trisomy 21).},

We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The transcription factor fusion CBFβ-SMMHC (core binding factor β and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain), expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16)(p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFβ for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML. Current inv(16) AML treatment with nonselective cytotoxic chemotherapy results in a good initial response but limited long-term survival. Here, we report the development of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor, AI-10-49, that selectively binds to CBFβ-SMMHC and disrupts its binding to RUNX1. AI-10-49 restores RUNX1 transcriptional activity, displays favorable pharmacokinetics, and delays leukemia progression in mice. Treatment of primary inv(16) AML patient blasts with AI-10-49 triggers selective cell death.

	abstract = {Transcription factors have traditionally been viewed with skepticism as viable drug targets, but they offer the potential for completely novel mechanisms of action that could more effectively address the stem cell like properties, such as self-renewal and chemo-resistance, that lead to the failure of traditional chemotherapy approaches. Core binding factor is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprised of one of 3 RUNX proteins (RUNX1-3) and a CBFβ binding partner. CBFβ enhances DNA binding of RUNX subunits by relieving auto-inhibition. Both RUNX1 and CBFβ are frequently mutated in human leukemia. More recently, RUNX proteins have been shown to be key players in epithelial cancers, suggesting the targeting of this pathway could have broad utility. In order to test this, we developed small molecules which bind to CBFβ and inhibit its binding to RUNX. Treatment with these inhibitors reduces binding of RUNX1 to target genes, alters the expression of RUNX1 target genes, and impacts cell survival and differentiation. These inhibitors show efficacy against leukemia cells as well as basal-like (triple-negative) breast cancer cells. These inhibitors provide effective tools to probe the utility of targeting RUNX transcription factor function in other cancers.,

The response rates were 76.9\% for ven/aza and 70.5\% for IC. The median overall survival (OS) was 884 days for IC compared with 483 days for ven/aza (P = .0020). A propensity-matched cohort was used to compare outcomes in the setting of equivalent baseline variables, and when matched for age, biological risk, and transplantation, the median OS was 705 days for IC compared with not reached for ven/aza (P = .0667). Variables that favored response to ven/aza over IC included older age, secondary AML, and RUNX1 mutations. AML M5 favored response to IC over ven/aza. In the propensity-matched cohort analyzing OS, older age, adverse risk, and RUNX1 mutations favored ven/aza over IC, whereas intermediate risk favored IC over ven/aza. In conclusion, patients receiving IC have improved OS compared with those receiving ven/aza. However, in a propensity-matched cohort of patients with equivalent baseline factors, there was a trend toward favorable OS for ven/aza. Specific variables, such as RUNX1 mutations, reported here for the first time, can be identified that favor ven/aza or IC, helping to guide treatment decisions for patients who may be eligible candidates for either therapy.},

Recently, c-Myc has also been demonstrated to be a potent inducer of apoptosis when expressed in the absence of serum or growth factors. To further examine Myc-induced apoptosis, we coexpressed the proto-oncogene bcl2, which has been shown to block apoptosis in other systems, with c-myc in serum-deprived Rat 1a fibroblasts. Here we report that ectopic expression of bcl2 specifically blocks apoptosis induced by constitutive c-myc expression. Constitutive c-myc expression in serum-deprived Rat 1a cells caused a {\textgreater} 15-fold increase in the number of dead cells, accompanied by DNA fragmentation. However, coexpression of bcl2 with c-myc in these cells led to a 10-fold increase in the number of live cells and a significant decrease in DNA fragmentation. Thus, Bcl-2 effectively inhibits Myc-induced apoptosis in serum-deprived Rat 1a fibroblasts without blocking entry into the cell cycle. These results imply that apoptosis serves as a protective mechanism to prevent tumorigenicity elicited by deregulated Myc expression. This protective mechanism is abrogated, however, by Bcl-2 and therefore may explain the synergism between Myc and Bcl-2 observed in certain tumor cells.},

MYC overexpression can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including gene duplications, chromosomal translocations, or somatic mutations leading to increased MYC stability. However, recent studies have identified numerous tissue-specific noncoding enhancers of MYC that play major roles in cancer, highlighting long-range transcriptional regulation of MYC as a critical novel mechanism leading to MYC hyperactivation and as a potential target for new therapeutic strategies in the near future. Here we summarize the regions and mechanisms involved in the long-range transcriptional regulation of MYC, underscoring the relevance of MYC enhancers both in normal physiological development and in MYC-driven cancer initiation and progression.},

Every year there are thousands of papers reporting on different aspects of their biochemistry, cellular and physiological mechanisms and functions. This plethora of literature can be attributed to both proteins playing essential roles in the normal functioning of a cell, and by extension a whole organism, but also due to their central role in disease, most notably, cancer. Many cancers arise due to genetic lesions resulting in deregulation of both proteins, and indeed the development and survival of tumours is often dependent on co-operativity between these protein families. In this review we will discuss the individual roles of both proteins in cancer, describe cancers where co-operativity between them has been well-characterised and finally, some strategies to target these proteins therapeutically.},

Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed the first genome-scale gene expression landscape covering the entire course of endothelial-to-HSC transition during human embryogenesis. The transcriptomically defined HSC-primed hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) were captured at Carnegie stage (CS) 12-14 in an unbiased way, showing an unambiguous feature of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) with the up-regulation of RUNX1, MYB and ANGPT1. Importantly, subcategorizing CD34+CD45- ECs into a CD44+ population strikingly enriched HECs by over 10-fold. We further mapped the developmental path from arterial ECs via HSC-primed HECs to hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, and revealed a distinct expression pattern of genes that were transiently over-represented upon the hemogenic fate choice of arterial ECs, including EMCN, PROCR and RUNX1T1. We also uncovered another temporally and molecularly distinct intra-embryonic HEC population, which was detected mainly at earlier CS 10 and lacked the arterial feature. Finally, we revealed the cellular components of the putative aortic niche and potential cellular interactions acting on the HSC-primed HECs. The cellular and molecular programs that underlie the generation of the first HSCs from HECs in human embryos, together with the ability to distinguish the HSC-primed HECs from others, will shed light on the strategies for the production of clinically useful HSCs from pluripotent stem cells.},

HE cells undergo an endothelial to hematopoietic cell transition, giving rise to HSPCs that accumulate in intra-arterial clusters (IAC) before colonizing the fetal liver. To examine the cell and molecular transitions between endothelial (E), HE, and IAC cells, and the heterogeneity of HSPCs within IACs, we profiled ∼40 000 cells from the caudal arteries (dorsal aorta, umbilical, vitelline) of 9.5 days post coitus (dpc) to 11.5 dpc mouse embryos by single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing. We identified a continuous developmental trajectory from E to HE to IAC cells, with identifiable intermediate stages. The intermediate stage most proximal to HE, which we term pre-HE, is characterized by increased accessibility of chromatin enriched for SOX, FOX, GATA, and SMAD motifs. A developmental bottleneck separates pre-HE from HE, with RUNX1 dosage regulating the efficiency of the pre-HE to HE transition. A distal candidate Runx1 enhancer exhibits high chromatin accessibility specifically in pre-HE cells at the bottleneck, but loses accessibility thereafter. Distinct developmental trajectories within IAC cells result in 2 populations of CD45+ HSPCs; an initial wave of lymphomyeloid-biased progenitors, followed by precursors of hematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs). This multiomics single-cell atlas significantly expands our understanding of pre-HSC ontogeny.},

Inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 with venetoclax emerged as a promising strategy for this subtype of BCP-ALL, however, lack of sufficient responses in preclinical models and the possibility of developing resistance exclude using venetoclax as monotherapy. Herein, we aimed to uncover potential mechanisms responsible for limited venetoclax activity in MLLr BCP-ALL and to identify drugs that could be used in combination therapy. Using RNA-seq, we observed that long-term exposure to venetoclax in vivo in a patient-derived xenograft model leads to downregulation of several tumor protein 53 (TP53)-related genes. Interestingly, auranofin, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, sensitized MLLr BCP-ALL to venetoclax in various in vitro and in vivo models, independently of the p53 pathway functionality. Synergistic activity of these drugs resulted from auranofin-mediated upregulation of NOXA pro-apoptotic protein and potent induction of apoptotic cell death. More specifically, we observed that auranofin orchestrates upregulation of the NOXA-encoding gene Phorbol-12-Myristate-13-Acetate-Induced Protein 1 (PMAIP1) associated with chromatin remodeling and increased transcriptional accessibility. Altogether, these results present an efficacious drug combination that could be considered for the treatment of MLLr BCP-ALL patients, including those with TP53 mutations.},

There are four mammalian Notch receptors that have only partially overlapping functions despite sharing similar structures and ligands. The ligands for Notch are transmembrane proteins expressed on adjacent cells, including Jagged and Delta, and it is quite possible that signaling is bidirectional. A large Notch precursor protein is proteolytically cleaved to form the mature cell-surface receptor. Ligand binding induces additional proteolytic events followed by translocation of the intracellular domain to the nucleus. There, Notch interacts with transcription factors such as RBPJ kappa, activating transcription of basic helix-loop-helix genes such as HES1. These in turn regulate expression of tissue-specific transcription factors that influence lineage commitment and other events. In this review, the details of Notch signaling will be discussed, with a focus on what is known about the role of Notch in hematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {The main oncogenic driver in T-lymphoblastic leukemia is NOTCH1, which activates genes by forming chromatin-associated Notch transcription complexes. Gamma-secretase-inhibitor treatment prevents NOTCH1 nuclear localization, but most genes with NOTCH1-binding sites are insensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that fewer than 10\% of NOTCH1-binding sites show dynamic changes in NOTCH1 occupancy when T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells are toggled between the Notch-on and -off states with gamma-secretase inhibiters. Dynamic NOTCH1 sites are functional, being highly associated with Notch target genes, are located mainly in distal enhancers, and frequently overlap with RUNX1 binding. In line with the latter association, we show that expression of IL7R, a gene with key roles in normal T-cell development and in T-lymphoblastic leukemia, is coordinately regulated by Runx factors and dynamic NOTCH1 binding to distal enhancers. Like IL7R, most Notch target genes and associated dynamic NOTCH1-binding sites cooccupy chromatin domains defined by constitutive binding of CCCTC binding factor, which appears to restrict the regulatory potential of dynamic NOTCH1 sites. More remarkably, the majority of dynamic NOTCH1 sites lie in superenhancers, distal elements with exceptionally broad and high levels of H3K27ac. Changes in Notch occupancy produces dynamic alterations in H3K27ac levels across the entire breadth of superenhancers and in the promoters of Notch target genes. These findings link regulation of superenhancer function to NOTCH1, a master regulatory factor and potent oncoprotein in the context of immature T cells, and delineate a generally applicable roadmap for identifying functional Notch sites in cellular genomes.},

Using a Runx1-/- embryonic stem cell differentiation model expressing an inducible Runx1 gene, we show that in the absence of RUNX1, haematopoietic genes bind SCL/TAL1, FLI1 and C/EBPβ and that this early priming is required for correct temporal expression of the myeloid master regulator PU.1 and its downstream targets. After induction, RUNX1 binds to numerous de novo sites, initiating a local increase in histone acetylation and rapid global alterations in the binding patterns of SCL/TAL1 and FLI1. The acquisition of haematopoietic fate controlled by Runx1 therefore does not represent the establishment of a new regulatory layer on top of a pre-existing HE program but instead entails global reorganization of lineage-specific transcription factor assemblies.},

This process crucially depends on the transcription factor RUNX1 which rapidly activates the expression of genes essential for haematopoietic development. Using an inducible version of RUNX1 in a mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation model we showed that prior to the EHT, haematopoietic genes are primed by the binding of the transcription factor FLI1. Once expressed, RUNX1 relocates FLI1 towards its binding sites. However, the nature of the transcription factor assemblies recruited by RUNX1 to reshape the chromatin landscape and initiate mRNA synthesis are unclear. Here, we performed genome-wide analyses of RUNX1-dependent binding of factors associated with transcription elongation to address this question. We demonstrate that RUNX1 induction moves FLI1 from distal ETS/GATA sites to RUNX1/ETS sites and recruits the basal transcription factors CDK9, BRD4, the Mediator complex and the looping factor LDB1. Our study explains how the expression of a single transcription factor can drive rapid and replication independent transitions in cellular shape which are widely observed in development and disease.},

Using human leukemia model systems, we establish that the down-regulation of SOX7 in BCP-ALL causes a significant decrease in proliferation and clonogenicity in vitro that correlates with a delay in leukemia initiation and burden in vivo.

	abstract = {The B cell lineage of the hematopoietic system is responsible for the generation of high-affinity antibodies, which provide humoral immunity for protection against foreign pathogens. B cell commitment and development depend on many transcription factors including Pax5. Here, we review the different functions of Pax5 in regulating various aspects of B lymphopoiesis. At B cell commitment, Pax5 restricts the developmental potential of lymphoid progenitors to the B cell pathway by repressing B-lineage-inappropriate genes, while it simultaneously promotes B cell development by activating B-lymphoid-specific genes. Pax5 thereby controls gene transcription by recruiting chromatin-remodeling, histone-modifying, and basal transcription factor complexes to its target genes. Moreover, Pax5 contributes to the diversity of the antibody repertoire by controlling V(H)-DJ(H) recombination by inducing contraction of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus in pro-B cells, which is likely mediated by PAIR elements in the 5' region of the V(H) gene cluster. Importantly, all mature B cell types depend on Pax5 for their differentiation and function. Pax5 thus controls the identity of B lymphocytes throughout B cell development. Consequently, conditional loss of Pax5 allows mature B cells from peripheral lymphoid organs to develop into functional T cells in the thymus via dedifferentiation to uncommitted progenitors in the bone marrow. Pax5 has also been implicated in human B cell malignancies because it can function as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor or oncogenic translocation fusion protein in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.},

	abstract = {In this Review, I present evidence supporting a multifactorial causation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a major subtype of paediatric cancer. ALL evolves in two discrete steps. First, in utero initiation by fusion gene formation or hyperdiploidy generates a covert, pre-leukaemic clone. Second, in a small fraction of these cases, the postnatal acquisition of secondary genetic changes (primarily V(D)J recombination-activating protein (RAG) and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-driven copy number alterations in the case of ETS translocation variant 6 (ETV6)-runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1)+ ALL) drives conversion to overt leukaemia. Epidemiological and modelling studies endorse a dual role for common infections. Microbial exposures earlier in life are protective but, in their absence, later infections trigger the critical secondary mutations. Risk is further modified by inherited genetics, chance and, probably, diet. Childhood ALL can be viewed as a paradoxical consequence of progress in modern societies, where behavioural changes have restrained early microbial exposure. This engenders an evolutionary mismatch between historical adaptations of the immune system and contemporary lifestyles. Childhood ALL may be a preventable cancer.},

Chromosomal translocations and preleukaemic clones arise at a substantially higher frequency ( approximately 100x) before birth than the cumulative incidence or risk of disease, reflecting the requirement for complementary and secondary genetic events that occur postnatally.

	abstract = {Human B-lymphopoiesis is a dynamic life-long process that starts in utero by around six post-conception weeks. A detailed understanding of human fetal B-lymphopoiesis and how it changes in postnatal life is vital for building a complete picture of normal B-lymphoid development through ontogeny, and its relevance in disease. B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is one of the most common cancers in children, with many of the leukemia-initiating events originating in utero. It is likely that the biology of B-ALL, including leukemia initiation, maintenance and progression depends on the developmental stage and type of B-lymphoid cell in which it originates. This is particularly important for early life leukemias, where specific characteristics of fetal B-cells might be key to determining how the disease behaves, including response to treatment. These cellular, molecular and/or epigenetic features are likely to change with age in a cell intrinsic and/or microenvironment directed manner. Most of our understanding of fetal B-lymphopoiesis has been based on murine data, but many recent studies have focussed on characterizing human fetal B-cell development, including functional and molecular assays at a single cell level. In this mini-review we will give a short overview of the recent advances in the understanding of human fetal B-lymphopoiesis, including its relevance to infant/childhood leukemia, and highlight future questions in the field.},

	abstract = {The chromatin adaptor Menin interacts with oncogenic fusion proteins encoded by MLL1-rearrangements (MLL1-r), and small molecules that disrupt these associations are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia. By integrating chromatin-focused and genome-wide CRISPR screens with genetic, pharmacological, and biochemical approaches in mouse and human systems, we discovered a molecular switch between the MLL1-Menin and MLL3/4-UTX chromatin modifying complexes that dictates response to Menin-MLL inhibitors. We show that MLL1-Menin safeguards leukemia survival by impeding binding of the MLL3/4-UTX complex at a subset of target gene promoters. Disrupting the interaction between Menin and MLL1 leads to UTX-dependent transcriptional activation of a tumor suppressor gene-program that is crucial for a therapeutic response in murine and human leukemia. We establish the therapeutic relevance of this mechanism by showing that CDK4/6 inhibitors allow re-activation of this tumor-suppressor program in Menin-inhibitor insensitive leukemia cells, mitigating treatment resistance. The discovery of a molecular switch between MLL1-Menin and MLL3/4-UTX complexes on chromatin sheds light on novel functions of these evolutionary conserved epigenetic mediators and is particularly relevant to understand and target molecular pathways determining response and resistance in ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trials.},

This concerted effort identified five distinct regulatory elements spread over 100kb each driving expression in transgenic mice to a subdomain of endogenous Gfi1. Detailed characterization of an enhancer 35 kb upstream of Gfi1 demonstrated activity in the dorsal aorta region and fetal liver in transgenic mice, which was bound by key stem cell transcription factors Scl/Tal1, PU.1/Sfpi1, Runx1, Erg, Meis1, and Gata2.

There are a variety of pathophysiologic conditions that are known to induce skeletal muscle atrophy. However, muscle wasting can occur through multiple distinct signaling pathways with differential sensitivity between selective skeletal muscle fiber subtypes. This review summarizes some of the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for fiber-specific muscle mass regulation.

Recent findings
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha protects slow-twitch oxidative fibers from denervation/immobilization (disuse)-induced muscle atrophies. Nutrient-related muscle atrophies, such as those induced by cancer cachexia, sepsis, chronic heart failure, or diabetes, are largely restricted to fast-twitch glycolytic fibers, of which the underlying mechanism is usually related to abnormality of protein degradation, including proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. In contrast, nuclear factor kappaB activation apparently serves a dual function by inducing both fast-twitch fiber atrophy and slow-twitch fiber degeneration.

Summary
Fast-twitch glycolytic fibers are more vulnerable than slow-twitch oxidative fibers under a variety of atrophic conditions related to signaling transduction of Forkhead box O family, autophagy inhibition, transforming growth factor beta family, and nuclear factor-kappaB. The resistance of oxidative fibers may result from the protection of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha.},

In contrast, non-canonical Wnt signals, activated by Wnt11, control exit from the pluripotent state and entry towards mesoderm specification. Unique to embryoid body (EB) formation of hESCs, Wnt11 induces development and arrangement of cells expressing Brachyury that co-express E-cadherin and Frizzled-7 (Fzd7). Knockdown of Fzd7 expression blocks Wnt-11 dependent specification.

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third cause of cancer-related death worldwide. When these tumors are in advanced stages, few therapeutic options are available. Therefore, it is essential to search for new treatments to fight this disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of cannabinoids – a novel family of potential anticancer agents – on the growth of HCC. We found that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, the main active component of Cannabis sativa) and JWH-015 (a cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) cannabinoid receptor-selective agonist) reduced the viability of the human HCC cell lines HepG2 (human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line) and HuH-7 (hepatocellular carcinoma cells), an effect that relied on the stimulation of CB2 receptor. We also found that Δ9-THC- and JWH-015-induced autophagy relies on tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) upregulation, and subsequent inhibition of the serine–threonine kinase Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin C1 axis and adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) stimulation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of AMPK upstream kinases supported that calmodulin-activated kinase kinase β was responsible for cannabinoid-induced AMPK activation and autophagy. In vivo studies revealed that Δ9-THC and JWH-015 reduced the growth of HCC subcutaneous xenografts, an effect that was not evident when autophagy was genetically of pharmacologically inhibited in those tumors. Moreover, cannabinoids were also able to inhibit tumor growth and ascites in an orthotopic model of HCC xenograft. Our findings may contribute to the design of new therapeutic strategies for the management of HCC.},

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) specification and expansion in the embryo has been hampered by the lack of analytical cell culture systems that recapitulate in vivo development. Here, we describe an ex vivo model that facilitates a rapid and robust emergence of multipotent long-term repopulating HSCs in the embryonic AGM region. Because this method includes a cell dissociation step prior to reconstruction of a three-dimensional functional tissue and preserves both stromal and hematopoietic elements, it allowed us to identify the direct ancestry of the rapidly expanding HSC pool. We demonstrate that extensive generation of definitive HSCs in the AGM occurs predominantly through the acquisition of stem characteristics by the VE-cadherin+CD45+ population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autophagy is critical in the maintenance of cellular protein quality control, the final step of which involves the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Cathepsin-L (CTSL) is a key member of the lysosomal protease family that is expressed in the murine and human heart, and it may play an important role in protein turnover. We hypothesized that CTSL is important in regulating protein processing in the heart, particularly under pathological stress.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vitro was more pronounced in CTSL-deficient neonatal cardiomyocytes than in in controls. This was accompanied by a significant accumulation of autophagosomes, increased levels of ubiquitin-conjugated protein, as well as impaired protein degradation and decreased cell viability. These effects were partially rescued with CTSL1 replacement via adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer. In the in vivo murine model of aortic banding (AB), a deficiency in CTSL markedly exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy, worsened cardiac function, and increased mortality. Ctsl(-/-) AB mice demonstrated significantly decreased lysosomal activity and increased sarcomere-associated protein aggregation. Homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum was also altered by CTSL deficiency, with increases in Bip and GRP94 proteins, accompanied by increased ubiquitin-proteasome system activity and higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins in response to AB. These changes ultimately led to a decrease in cellular ATP production, enhanced oxidative stress, and increased cellular apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Lysosomal CTSL attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and preserves cardiac function through facilitation of autophagy and proteasomal protein processing.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating response to fasting, disuse, cancer, and other systemic diseases. In atrophying muscles, the ubiquitin ligase, atrogin-1 (MAFbx), is dramatically induced, and this response is necessary for rapid atrophy. Here, we show that in cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway decreases, leading to activation of Foxo transcription factors and atrogin-1 induction. IGF-1 treatment or AKT overexpression inhibits Foxo and atrogin-1 expression. Moreover, constitutively active Foxo3 acts on the atrogin-1 promoter to cause atrogin-1 transcription and dramatic atrophy of myotubes and muscle fibers. When Foxo activation is blocked by a dominant-negative construct in myotubes or by RNAi in mouse muscles in vivo, atrogin-1 induction during starvation and atrophy of myotubes induced by glucocorticoids are prevented. Thus, forkhead factor(s) play a critical role in the development of muscle atrophy, and inhibition of Foxo factors is an attractive approach to combat muscle wasting.},

	abstract = {Rho GTPases represent a family of small GTP-binding proteins involved in cell cytoskeleton organization, migration, transcription, and proliferation. A common theme of these processes is a dynamic reorganization of actin cytoskeleton which has now emerged as a major switch control mainly carried out by Rho and Rac GTPase subfamilies, playing an acknowledged role in adaptation of cell motility to the microenvironment. Cells exhibit three distinct modes of migration when invading the 3 D environment. Collective motility leads to movement of cohorts of cells which maintain the adherens junctions and move by photolytic degradation of matrix barriers. Single cell mesenchymal-type movement is characterized by an elongated cellular shape and again requires extracellular proteolysis and integrin engagement. In addition it depends on Rac1-mediated cell polarization and lamellipodia formation. Conversely, in amoeboid movement cells have a rounded morphology, the movement is independent from proteases but requires high Rho GTPase to drive elevated levels of actomyosin contractility. These two modes of cell movement are interconvertible and several moving cells, including tumor cells, show an high degree of plasticity in motility styles shifting ad hoc between mesenchymal or amoeboid movements. This review will focus on the role of Rac and Rho small GTPases in cell motility and in the complex relationship driving the reciprocal control between Rac and Rho granting for the opportunistic motile behaviour of aggressive cancer cells. In addition we analyse the role of these GTPases in cancer progression and metastatic dissemination.},

Nephrotoxicity is a common complication of cisplatin chemotherapy, which involves increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, limiting its clinical use. In this study, we have investigated the effects of a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid cannabidiol, which was reported to exert antioxidant effects and has recently been approved for the treatment of inflammation, pain, and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis in patients in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced nephropathy. Cisplatin induced increased expression of superoxide-generating enzymes RENOX (NOX4) and NOX1, enhanced reactive oxygen species generation, inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, nitrotyrosine formation, apoptosis (caspase-3/7 activity, DNA fragmentation, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity, and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) in the kidneys of mice, associated with marked histopathological damage and impaired renal function (elevated serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels) 72 h after the administration of the drug. Treatment of mice with cannabidiol markedly attenuated the cisplatin-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and cell death in the kidney, and it improved renal function. Thus, our results suggest that cannabidiol may represent a promising new protective strategy against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.},

Although the possible involvement of autophagy in homeostasis, development, cell death, and pathogenesis has been repeatedly pointed out, systematic in vivo analysis has not been performed in mammals, mainly because of a limitation of monitoring methods. To understand where and when autophagy occurs in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice systemically expressing GFP fused to LC3, which is a mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8 (Aut7/Apg8) and serves as a marker protein for autophagosomes. Fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that autophagy is differently induced by nutrient starvation in most tissues. In some tissues, autophagy even occurs actively without starvation treatments. Our results suggest that the regulation of autophagy is organ dependent and the role of autophagy is not restricted to the starvation response. This transgenic mouse model is a useful tool to study mammalian autophagy.},

Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Leukemogenic MLL fusion proteins delete the MLL SET domain Lys(4) methyltransferase activity and fuse MLL to 1 of {\textgreater}40 different translocation partners. Some MLL fusion proteins involve nuclear proteins that are transcriptional activators, whereas others have transcriptional activating activity but instead dimerize the truncated MLL molecule. Both types of MLL fusion proteins enforce persistent expression of Hox a9 and Meis1, which is pivotal for leukemogenesis through mechanisms that remain obscure. Here, we show that nuclear and dimerizable forms of MLL bind with a similar pattern to the Hox a9 locus that overlaps the distribution of wild-type MLL and deregulate transcription of three isoforms of Hox a9. Induction of MLL fusion protein activity is associated with increased levels of histone acetylation and Lys(4) methylation at Hox target genes. In addition, the MLL-ENL-ER protein, but not dimerized MLL, also induces dimethylation of histone H3 at Lys(79), suggesting alternative mechanisms for transcriptional activation.},

In our efforts to define a cancer dependency map, we performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens across 342 cancer cell lines and applied CERES to this data set. We found that CERES decreased false-positive results and estimated sgRNA activity for both this data set and previously published screens performed with different sgRNA libraries.

In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.

Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature.Results: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications.Availability and implementation: featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.Contact: shi@wehi.edu.au},

	abstract = {Summary: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.Availability:http://samtools.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

	abstract = {Protein carbonylation is a well-documented and quantifiable consequence of oxidative stress in several neuropathologies, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer׳s disease, and Parkinson׳s disease. Although oxidative stress is a hallmark of traumatic brain injury (TBI), little work has explored the specific neural regions and cell types in which protein carbonylation occurs. Furthermore, the effect of gender on protein carbonylation after TBI has not been studied. The present investigation was designed to determine the regional and cell specificity of TBI-induced protein carbonylation and how this response to injury is affected by gender. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize protein carbonylation in the brains of adult male and female Sprague–Dawley rats subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) as an injury model of TBI. Cell-specific markers were used to colocalize the presence of carbonylated proteins in specific cell types, including astrocytes, neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Results also indicated that the injury lesion site, ventral portion of the dorsal third ventricle, and ventricular lining above the median eminence showed dramatic increases in protein carbonylation after injury. Specifically, astrocytes and limited regions of ependymal cells adjacent to the dorsal third ventricle and the median eminence were most susceptible to postinjury protein carbonylation. However, these patterns of differential susceptibility to protein carbonylation were gender dependent, with males showing significantly greater protein carbonylation at sites distant from the lesion. Proteomic analyses were also conducted and determined that the proteins most affected by carbonylation in response to TBI include glial fibrillary acidic protein, dihydropyrimidase-related protein 2, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A. Many other proteins, however, were not carbonylated by CCI. These findings indicate that there is both regional and protein specificity in protein carbonylation after TBI. The marked increase in carbonylation seen in ependymal layers distant from the lesion suggests a mechanism involving the transmission of a cerebral spinal fluid-borne factor to these sites. Furthermore, this process is affected by gender, suggesting that hormonal mechanisms may serve a protective role against oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.},

Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

	abstract = {Tubulointerstitial inflammation is a common feature of renal diseases. We have investigated the relationship between inflammation and Na(+) transport in the collecting duct (CD) using the mCCD(cl1) and mpkCDD(cl4) principal cell models. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreased basal and aldosterone-stimulated amiloride-sensitive transepithelial current in a time-dependent manner. This effect was associated with a decrease in serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) mRNA and protein levels followed by a decrease in epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) alpha-subunit mRNA levels. The LPS-induced decrease in SGK1 expression was confirmed in isolated rat CD. This decreased expression of either SGK1 or the ENaC alpha-subunit was not due to enhanced degradation of mRNA. In contrast, LPS inhibited transcriptional activity of the SGK1 promoter measured by luciferase-reporter gene assay. The effect of LPS was not mediated by inhibition of mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptor, because expression of both receptors was unchanged and blockade of either receptor by spironolactone or RU486, respectively, did not prevent the down-regulation of SGK1. The effect of LPS was mediated by the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, as overexpression of a constitutively active mutant, IKKbeta (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB kinase-beta) decreased SGK1 mRNA levels, and knockdown of p65 NF-kappaB subunit by small interfering RNA increased SGK1 mRNA levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that LPS increased p65 binding to two NF-kappaB sites along the SGK1 promoter. In conclusion, we show that activation of the NF-kappaB pathway down-regulates SGK1 expression, which might lead to decreased ENaC alpha-subunit expression, ultimately resulting in decreased Na(+) transport.},

The poor survival rate and lack of an effective targeted therapy for patients with MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemias emphasize an urgent need for improved knowledge and novel therapeutic approaches for these malignancies. The resulting chimeric products of MLL gene rearrangements, i.e., MLL-fusion proteins (MLL-FPs), are capable of transforming hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) into leukemic blasts. The ability of MLL-FPs to reprogram HSPCs toward leukemia requires the involvement of multiple chromatin effectors, including the histone 3 lysine 79 methyltransferase DOT1L, the chromatin epigenetic reader BRD4, and the super elongation complex. These epigenetic regulators constitute a complicated network that dictates maintenance of the leukemia program, and therefore represent an important cluster of therapeutic opportunities. In this review, we will discuss the role of MLL and its fusion partners in normal HSPCs and hematopoiesis, including the links between chromatin effectors, epigenetic landscapes, and leukemia development, and summarize current approaches to therapeutic targeting of MLL-r leukemias.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscles adapt to changes in their workload by regulating fibre size by unknown mechanisms. The roles of two signalling pathways implicated in muscle hypertrophy on the basis of findings in vitro, Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), were investigated in several models of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy in vivo. The Akt/mTOR pathway was upregulated during hypertrophy and downregulated during muscle atrophy. Furthermore, rapamycin, a selective blocker of mTOR, blocked hypertrophy in all models tested, without causing atrophy in control muscles. In contrast, the calcineurin pathway was not activated during hypertrophy in vivo, and inhibitors of calcineurin, cyclosporin A and FK506 did not blunt hypertrophy. Finally, genetic activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway was sufficient to cause hypertrophy and prevent atrophy in vivo, whereas genetic blockade of this pathway blocked hypertrophy in vivo. We conclude that the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway and its downstream targets, p70S6K and PHAS-1/4E-BP1, is requisitely involved in regulating skeletal muscle fibre size, and that activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway can oppose muscle atrophy induced by disuse.},

	abstract = {A number of acute leukemias arise from fusion of the mixed lineage leukemia 1 protein (MLL) N terminus to a variety of fusion partners that have been reported to reside in one or more poorly defined complexes linked to transcription elongation through interactions with the histone H3-K79 methyltransferase DOT1 and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). Here we first identify natural complexes (purified through fusion partners AF9, AF4, and ELL) with overlapping components, different elongation activities, and different cofactor associations that suggest dynamic interactions. Then, through reconstitution of defined, functionally active minimal complexes, we identify stable subcomplexes that, through newly defined protein-protein interactions, form distinct higher order complexes. These definitive analyses show, for example, that (i) through direct interactions with AF9 and cyclinT1, family members AF4 and AFF4 independently mediate association of P-TEFb with AF9, (ii) P-TEFb, through direct interactions, provides the link for association of ELL and ELL-associated factors 1 and 2 (EAF1 and EAF2) with AF4, and (iii) in the absence of other factors, DOT1 forms a stable complex with AF9 and does not interact with AF9•AF4•P-TEFb complexes. Finally, we show the importance of defined higher order complex formation in MLL–AF9-mediated transcriptional up-regulation and cell immortalization potential in vivo. Thus, our study provides direct mechanistic insight into the role of fusion partners in MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis.},

Generation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is not currently possible, however, necessitating a better understanding of how HSCs normally arise during embryonic development. We previously showed that haematopoiesis occurs through four distinct waves during zebrafish development, with HSCs arising in the final wave in close association with the dorsal aorta. Recent reports have suggested that murine HSCs derive from haemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) lining the aortic floor. Additional in vitro studies have similarly indicated that the haematopoietic progeny of ESCs arise through intermediates with endothelial potential. Here we have used the unique strengths of the zebrafish embryo to image directly the generation of HSCs from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta. Using combinations of fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry, we have identified and isolated the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs. Finally, using a permanent lineage tracing strategy, we demonstrate that the HSCs generated from haemogenic endothelium are the lineal founders of the adult haematopoietic system.},

Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) mutations such as the t(4;11) translocation cause aggressive leukemias that are refractory to conventional treatment. The t(4;11) translocation produces an MLL/AF4 fusion protein that activates key target genes through both epigenetic and transcriptional elongation mechanisms. In this study, we show that t(4;11) patient cells express high levels of BCL-2 and are highly sensitive to treatment with the BCL-2-specific BH3 mimetic ABT-199. We demonstrate that MLL/AF4 specifically upregulates the BCL-2 gene but not other BCL-2 family members via DOT1L-mediated H3K79me2/3. We use this information to show that a t(4;11) cell line is sensitive to a combination of ABT-199 and DOT1L inhibitors.

	abstract = {Regulatory interactions mediated by transcription factors (TFs) make up complex networks that control cellular behavior. Fully understanding these gene regulatory networks (GRNs) offers greater insight into the consequences of disease-causing perturbations than can be achieved by studying single TF binding events in isolation. Chromosomal translocations of the lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) gene produce KMT2A fusion proteins such as KMT2A-AFF1 (previously MLL-AF4), causing poor prognosis acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) that sometimes relapse as acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). KMT2A-AFF1 drives leukemogenesis through direct binding and inducing the aberrant overexpression of key genes, such as the anti-apoptotic factor BCL2 and the proto-oncogene MYC However, studying direct binding alone does not incorporate possible network-generated regulatory outputs, including the indirect induction of gene repression. To better understand the KMT2A-AFF1-driven regulatory landscape, we integrated ChIP-seq, patient RNA-seq, and CRISPR essentiality screens to generate a model GRN. This GRN identified several key transcription factors such as RUNX1 that regulate target genes downstream of KMT2A-AFF1 using feed-forward loop (FFL) and cascade motifs. A core set of nodes are present in both ALL and AML, and CRISPR screening revealed several factors that help mediate response to the drug venetoclax. Using our GRN, we then identified a KMT2A-AFF1:RUNX1 cascade that represses CASP9, as well as KMT2A-AFF1-driven FFLs that regulate BCL2 and MYC through combinatorial TF activity. This illustrates how our GRN can be used to better connect KMT2A-AFF1 behavior to downstream pathways that contribute to leukemogenesis, and potentially predict shifts in gene expression that mediate drug response.},

Here, we show that quantitating the temporal regulation of key gene states (transcriptionally inactive, active, and refractory) provides a parsimonious framework for analyzing gene regulation. Our theory makes two non-intuitive predictions. First, for transcription factors (TFs) that regulate transcription burst frequency, as opposed to amplitude or duration, weak TF binding is sufficient to elicit strong transcriptional responses. Second, refractoriness of a gene after a transcription burst enables rapid responses to stimuli. We validate both predictions experimentally by exploiting the natural, optogenetic-like responsiveness of the Neurospora GATA-type TF White Collar Complex (WCC) to blue light. Further, we demonstrate that differential regulation of WCC target genes is caused by different gene activation rates, not different TF occupancy, and that these rates are tuned by both the core promoter and the distance between TF-binding site and core promoter. In total, our work demonstrates the relevance of a kinetic, non-equilibrium framework for understanding transcriptional regulation.},

However, directly inhibiting this target requires the disruption of high-affinity protein–protein interactions, and therefore designing small molecules potent enough to inhibit MCL-1 in cells has proven extremely challenging. Here, we describe a series of indole-2-carboxylic acids, exemplified by the compound A-1210477, that bind to MCL-1 selectively and with sufficient affinity to disrupt MCL-1–BIM complexes in living cells. A-1210477 induces the hallmarks of intrinsic apoptosis and demonstrates single agent killing of multiple myeloma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines demonstrated to be MCL-1 dependent by BH3 profiling or siRNA rescue experiments. As predicted, A-1210477 synergizes with the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor navitoclax to kill a variety of cancer cell lines. This work represents the first description of small-molecule MCL-1 inhibitors with sufficient potency to induce clear on-target cellular activity. It also demonstrates the utility of these molecules as chemical tools for dissecting the basic biology of MCL-1 and the promise of small-molecule MCL-1 inhibitors as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.},

Rearrangement of ZNF384 is common in B/M MPAL, and biallelic WT1 alterations are common in T/M MPAL, which shares genomic features with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We show that the intratumoral immunophenotypic heterogeneity characteristic of MPAL is independent of somatic genetic variation, that founding lesions arise in primitive haematopoietic progenitors, and that individual phenotypic subpopulations can reconstitute the immunophenotypic diversity in vivo. These findings indicate that the cell of origin and founding lesions, rather than an accumulation of distinct genomic alterations, prime tumour cells for lineage promiscuity. Moreover, these findings position MPAL in the spectrum of immature leukaemias and provide a genetically informed framework for future clinical trials of potential treatments for MPAL.},

Even with very deep genome coverage, short read lengths cause problems in de novo assemblies. The use of paired-end libraries with a fragment size shorter than twice the read length provides an opportunity to generate much longer reads by overlapping and merging read pairs before assembling a genome.
RESULTS: We present FLASH, a fast computational tool to extend the length of short reads by overlapping paired-end reads from fragment libraries that are sufficiently short. We tested the correctness of the tool on one million simulated read pairs, and we then applied it as a pre-processor for genome assemblies of Illumina reads from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and human chromosome 14. FLASH correctly extended and merged reads {\textgreater}99\% of the time on simulated reads with an error rate of {\textless}1\%. With adequately set parameters, FLASH correctly merged reads over 90\% of the time even when the reads contained up to 5\% errors. When FLASH was used to extend reads prior to assembly, the resulting assemblies had substantially greater N50 lengths for both contigs and scaffolds.

RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.},

        , Tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product targeting CD19 is approved for relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the impact of pretreatment variables, such as CD19 expression level, on leukemic blasts, the presence of CD19– subpopulations, and especially prior CD19-targeted therapy, on the response to CAR T-cell therapy has not been determined. We analyzed 166 patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy at our institution. Eleven patients did not achieve a minimal residual disease (MRD)– deep remission, whereas 67 patients had a recurrence after achieving a MRD– deep remission: 28 patients with CD19+ leukemia and 39 patients with CD19– leukemia. Return of CD19+ leukemia was associated with loss of CAR T-cell function, whereas CD19– leukemia was associated with continued CAR T-cell function. There were no significant differences in efficacy of CAR T cells in CD19-dim B-ALL, compared with CD19-normal or -bright B-ALL. Consistent with this, CAR T cells recognized and lysed cells with very low levels of CD19 expression in vitro. The presence of dim CD19 or rare CD19– events by flow cytometry did not predict nonresponse or recurrence after CAR T-cell therapy. However, prior therapy with the CD19-directed, bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab was associated with a significantly higher rate of failure to achieve MRD– remission or subsequent loss of remission with antigen escape. Finally, immunophenotypic heterogeneity and lineage plasticity were independent of underlying clonotype and cytogenetic abnormalities.,},

This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed "bivalent domains," consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.},

Human MLL-rearranged ALLs could be distinguished from other ALLs by their H3K79 profiles, and suppression of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L inhibited expression of critical MLL-AF4 target genes.

Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and insulation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Further, our data support that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer-blocking but not as a direct barrier to heterochromatin spreading. Beyond defining the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding these results provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.},

	abstract = {A T-cell-specific transcriptional enhancer lies within the J delta 3-C delta intron of the human T-cell receptor delta gene. We have previously shown that a 30-bp element, denoted delta E3, acts as the minimal TCR delta enhancer and that within delta E3, adjacent and precisely spaced binding sites for core-binding factor (CBF/PEBP2) and c-Myb are essential for transcriptional activity. These data suggested that CBF/PEBP2 and c-Myb synergize to mediate transcriptional activity but did not establish the molecular basis for synergy. In this study, we have examined in detail the binding of CBF/PEBP2 and c-Myb to delta E3. We found that CBF/PEBP2 and c-Myb could simultaneously occupy the core site and one of two overlapping Myb sites within delta E3. However, equilibrium binding and kinetic dissociation experiments suggest that the two factors bind to delta E3 independently, rather than cooperatively. This was found to be true by using isoforms of these factors present in extracts of transfected COS-7 cells, as well as the natural factors present in nuclear extracts of the Jurkat T-cell line. We further showed that CBF/PEBP2 and c-Myb provide unique transactivation functions, since the core-Myb combination cannot be substituted by dimerized core or Myb sites. We propose that spatially precise synergy between CBF/PEBP2 and c-Myb may result from the ability of the two factors to form a composite surface that makes unique and stereospecific contacts with one or more additional components of the transcriptional machinery.},

As a single agent, ABT-199 was as effective as ABT-737 in prolonging survival of immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice without causing thrombocytopenia. Both drugs acted rapidly but, contrary to prevailing models, their apoptotic activity did not rely upon the BH3-only protein Bim.

In these cases, tonic pre-BCR signaling induced activation of BCL6, which in turn increased pre-BCR signaling output at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, inhibition of pre-BCR-related tyrosine kinases reduced constitutive BCL6 expression and selectively killed patient-derived pre-BCR(+) ALL cells.

The targeted cells can be used for generating a mouse either by injection into blastocysts or by morula aggregation. Alternatively, the ES cells can be used for targeting the second allele and thus creating an in-vitro knockout model. In the latter case, the phenotype of the mutation can be analyzed either in the undifferentiated state or after differentiation of the cells into the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). This protocol describes only a part of the pipeline for generating a conditional knockout mouse. The whole procedure includes (1) design and generation of the targeting construct, (2) generation of targeted ES clones, and (3) generation of the knockout mouse. Detailed protocols for preparing DNA, culturing ES cells, and screening the transfected ES clones for correct targeted events by long-range PCR or Southern blotting can be found elsewhere (see Isolation of Genomic DNA from Mammalian Cells and Analysis of DNA by Southern Blotting). Here, we describe only the protocol used for transfecting the targeting construct into ES cells and for removing antibiotic selection cassettes or other DNA fragments flanked by site-specific recombination target sites using transient transfection of recombinase expression vectors. In addition, we describe a short protocol for screening the clones that underwent complete recombination. A protocol to prepare DNA from 96-, 48-, and 24-well plates is also described.},

Here we describe a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. Beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1-2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2-3 weeks.},

Synaptic structural integrity is crucial for efficient signal transmission. Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders that result from impaired neuromuscular transmission, caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that are involved in synaptic transmission and in forming and maintaining the structural integrity of NMJs. To identify further causes of CMSs, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in families without an identified mutation in known CMS-associated genes. In two families affected by a previously undefined CMS, we identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in COL13A1, which encodes the alpha chain of an atypical non-fibrillar collagen with a single transmembrane domain. COL13A1 localized to the human muscle motor endplate. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, modeling of the COL13A1 c.1171delG (p.Leu392Sfs∗71) frameshift mutation in the C2C12 cell line reduced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering during myotube differentiation. This highlights the crucial role of collagen XIII in the formation and maintenance of the NMJ. Our results therefore delineate a myasthenic disorder that is caused by loss-of-function mutations in COL13A1, encoding a protein involved in organization of the NMJ, and emphasize the importance of appropriate symptomatic treatment for these individuals.},

Here, we comprehensively analyze the requirement for Kit ligand (Kitl) in the yolk sac and aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) niche. In-depth analysis of loss-of-function and transgenic reporter mouse models show that Kitl-deficient embryos harbor decreased numbers of yolk sac erythro-myeloid progenitor (EMP) cells, resulting from a proliferation defect following their initial emergence. This EMP defect causes a dramatic decrease in fetal liver erythroid cells prior to the onset of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived erythropoiesis, and a reduction in tissue-resident macrophages. Pre-HSCs in the AGM require Kitl for survival and maturation, but not proliferation. Although Kitl is expressed widely in all embryonic hematopoietic niches, conditional deletion in endothelial cells recapitulates germline loss-of-function phenotypes in AGM and yolk sac, with phenotypic HSCs but not EMPs remaining dependent on endothelial Kitl upon migration to the fetal liver. In conclusion, our data establish Kitl as a critical regulator in the in vivoAGM and yolk sac endothelial niche.},

This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

	abstract = {Background
Cell lines are an indispensable tool in biomedical research and often used as surrogates for tissues. Although there are recognized important cellular and transcriptomic differences between cell lines and tissues, a systematic overview of the differences between the regulatory processes of a cell line and those of its tissue of origin has not been conducted. The RNA-Seq data generated by the GTEx project is the first available data resource in which it is possible to perform a large-scale transcriptional and regulatory network analysis comparing cell lines with their tissues of origin.

Results
We compared 127 paired Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and whole blood samples, and 244 paired primary fibroblast cell lines and skin samples. While gene expression analysis confirms that these cell lines carry the expression signatures of their primary tissues, albeit at reduced levels, network analysis indicates that expression changes are the cumulative result of many previously unreported alterations in transcription factor (TF) regulation. More specifically, cell cycle genes are over-expressed in cell lines compared to primary tissues, and this alteration in expression is a result of less repressive TF targeting. We confirmed these regulatory changes for four TFs, including SMAD5, using independent ChIP-seq data from ENCODE.

Conclusions
Our results provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression differences between cell lines and tissues. The strong changes in TF regulation that we observe suggest that network changes, in addition to transcriptional levels, should be considered when using cell lines as models for tissues.

Several general features including the presence of specific histone modifications are used to demarcate potentially active enhancers. Here we reveal that putative enhancers marked with H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) di or trimethylation (me2/3) (which we name H3K79me2/3 enhancer elements or KEEs) can be found in multiple cell types. Mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) rearrangements (MLL-r) such as MLL-AF4 are a major cause of incurable acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Using the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676 in MLL-AF4 leukemia cells, we show that H3K79me2/3 is required for maintaining chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation and transcription factor binding specifically at KEEs but not non-KEE enhancers. We go on to show that H3K79me2/3 is essential for maintaining enhancer-promoter interactions at a subset of KEEs. Together, these data implicate H3K79me2/3 as having a functional role at a subset of active enhancers in MLL-AF4 leukemia cells., Histone 3 lysine 79 is mono (me1), di (me2), or tri (me3) methylated by the methyltransferase DOT1L.

	abstract = {Acute leukemias are the most common cancer in childhood and characterized by the uncontrolled production of hematopoietic precursor cells of the lymphoid or myeloid series within the bone marrow. Even when a relatively high efficiency of therapeutic agents has increased the overall survival rates in the last years, factors such as cell lineage switching and the rise of mixed lineages at relapses often change the prognosis of the illness. During lineage switching, conversions from lymphoblastic leukemia to myeloid leukemia, or vice versa, are recorded. The central mechanisms involved in these phenomena remain undefined, but recent studies suggest that lineage commitment of plastic hematopoietic progenitors may be multidirectional and reversible upon specific signals provided by both intrinsic and environmental cues. In this paper, we focus on the current knowledge about cell heterogeneity and the lineage switch resulting from leukemic cells plasticity. A number of hypothetical mechanisms that may inspire changes in cell fate decisions are highlighted. Understanding the plasticity of leukemia initiating cells might be fundamental to unravel the pathogenesis of lineage switch in acute leukemias and will illuminate the importance of a flexible hematopoietic development.},

Mice homozygous for an Ikaros null mutation display a {\textgreater}30-fold reduction in long-term repopulation units, whereas mice homozygous for an Ikaros dominant negative mutation have no measurable activity. The defect in HSC activity is also illustrated by the ability of wild-type marrow to repopulate unconditioned Ikaros mutants. A progressive reduction in multipotent CFU-S(14) (colony-forming unit-spleen) progenitors and the earliest erythroid-restricted precursors (BFU-E [burst-forming unit-erythroid]) is also detected in the Ikaros mutant strains consistent with the reduction in HSCs. Nonetheless, the more mature clonogenic erythroid and myeloid precursors are less affected, indicating either the action of a compensatory mechanism to provide more progeny or a negative role of Ikaros at later stages of erythromyeloid differentiation. In Ikaros mutant mice, a decrease in expression of the tyrosine kinase receptors flk-2 and c-kit is observed in the lineage-depleted c-kit(+)Sca-1(+) population that is normally enriched for HSCs and may in part contribute to the early hemopoietic phenotypes manifested in the absence of Ikaros.},

This, however, is a stepwise process that occurs through sequential upregulation of CD41 and CD45 followed by emergence of fully functional definitive HSCs. Although largely dispensable at later stages, the Runx1 transcription factor is crucially important during developmental maturation of HSCs; however, exact points of crucial involvement of Runx1 in this multi-step developmental maturation process remain unclear. Here, we have investigated requirements for Runx1 using a conditional reversible knockout strategy. We report that Runx1 deficiency does not preclude formation of VE-cad+CD45-CD41+ cells, which are phenotypically equivalent to precursors of definitive HSCs (pre-HSC Type I) but blocks transition to the subsequent CD45+ stage (pre-HSC Type II).

To date, hematopoietic engraftment has mostly been achieved through the enforced expression of ectopic transcription factors. Here, we describe serum-free culture conditions that allow the generation of in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells in the absence of ectopically expressed factors. We show that repopulating activity arises immediately upon the commitment of mesodermal precursors to the blood program, within the first wave of hematopoietic specification. We establish that the formation of these progenitors is extremely transient and exquisitely sensitive to the cytokine milieu. Our findings define the precise differentiating stage at which hematopoietic repopulating activity first appears in vitro, and suggest that during embryonic stem cell differentiation, all hematopoietic programs are unraveled simultaneously from the mesoderm in the absence of cues that restrict the coordinated emergence of each lineage as is normally observed during embryogenesis.,

        , In this article, Kouskoff, Lacaud, and colleagues show that serum-free in vitro differentiated embryonic stem cells give rise to in vivo repopulating hematopoietic progenitors, that the repopulating activity arises immediately upon the commitment of mesodermal precursors to the blood program, and that the formation of these progenitors is extremely transient and exquisitely sensitive to the cytokine milieu.},

	abstract = {In addition to its important role in the regulation of somatic growth by acting as the major circulating transport protein for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) has a variety of intracellular ligands that point to its function within major signaling pathways. The discovery of its interaction with the retinoid X receptor has led to the elucidation of roles in regulating the function of several nuclear hormone receptors including retinoic acid receptor-α, Nur77 and vitamin D receptor. Its interaction with the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ is believed to be involved in regulating adipocyte differentiation, which is also modulated by IGFBP-3 through an interaction with TGFβ/Smad signaling. IGFBP-3 can induce apoptosis alone or in conjunction with other agents, and in different systems can activate caspases −8 and −9. At least two unrelated proteins (LRP1 and TMEM219) have been designated as receptors for IGFBP-3, the latter with a demonstrated role in inducing caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, IGFBP-3 also has demonstrated roles in survival-related functions, including the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor and DNA-dependent protein kinase, and the induction of autophagy through interaction with GRP78. The ability of IGFBP-3 to modulate the balance between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival sphingolipids by regulating sphingosine kinase 1 and sphingomyelinases may be integral to its role at the crossroads between cell death and survival in response to a variety of stimuli. The pleiotropic nature of IGFBP-3 activity supports the idea that IGFBP-3 itself, or pathways with which it interacts, should be investigated as targets of therapy for a variety of diseases.},

Because of small numbers of embryonal arterial cells undergoing EHT and the paucity of markers to enrich for hemogenic endothelial cells (ECs [HECs]), the genetic program driving HSC emergence is largely unknown. Here, we use a highly sensitive RNAseq method to examine the whole transcriptome of small numbers of enriched aortic HSCs, HECs, and ECs. Gpr56, a G-coupled protein receptor, is one of the most highly up-regulated of the 530 differentially expressed genes. Also, highly up-regulated are hematopoietic transcription factors, including the "heptad" complex of factors. We show that Gpr56 (mouse and human) is a target of the heptad complex and is required for hematopoietic cluster formation during EHT. Our results identify the processes and regulators involved in EHT and reveal the surprising requirement for Gpr56 in generating the first HSCs.},

Before leukemia, these mice do not display elevation of white blood cells in the spleen or bone marrow; rather, the hematopoietic compartment shows lineage-skewing, with myeloid cell numbers dramatically increased and B-cell numbers severely diminished. miR-125b exerts this effect by up-regulating the number of common myeloid progenitors while inhibiting development of pre-B cells. We applied a miR-125b sponge loss of function system in vivo to show that miR-125b physiologically regulates hematopoietic development. Investigating the mechanism by which miR-125b regulates hematopoiesis, we found that, among a panel of candidate targets, the mRNA for Lin28A, an induced pluripotent stem cell gene, was most repressed by miR-125b in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Overexpressing Lin28A in the mouse hematopoietic system mimicked the phenotype observed on inhibiting miR-125b function, leading to a decrease in hematopoietic output. Relevant to the miR-125b overexpression phenotype, we also found that knockdown of Lin28A led to hematopoietic lineage-skewing, with increased myeloid and decreased B-cell numbers. Thus, the miR-125b target Lin28A is an important regulator of hematopoiesis and a primary target of miR-125b in the hematopoietic system.},

The Notch signaling mutant mind bomb displays normal embryonic hematopoiesis but fails to specify adult HSCs. Surprisingly, transient Notch activation during embryogenesis via an inducible transgenic system led to a Runx1-dependent expansion of HSCs in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. In irradiated adults, Notch activity induced runx1 gene expression and increased multilineage hematopoietic precursor cells approximately threefold in the marrow. This increase was followed by the accelerated recovery of all the mature blood cell lineages. These data define the Notch–Runx pathway as critical for the developmental specification of HSC fate and the subsequent homeostasis of HSC number, thus providing a mechanism for amplifying stem cells in vivo.},

We then used these to uncover distinct associations between DHSs and promoters, CpG islands, conserved elements, and transcription factor motif enrichment. Motif analysis within clusters identified known and novel motifs in cell-type-specific and ubiquitous regulatory elements and supports a role for AP-1 regulating open chromatin. We developed a classifier that accurately predicts cell-type lineage based on only 43 DHSs and evaluated the tissue of origin for cancer cell types. A similar classifier identified three sex-specific loci on the X chromosome, including the XIST lincRNA locus. By correlating DNase I signal and gene expression, we predicted regulated genes for more than 500K DHSs. Finally, we introduce a web resource to enable researchers to use these results to explore these regulatory patterns and better understand how expression is modulated within and across human cell types.},

The molecular mechanisms linking intracellular signaling network of HPCs with their microenvironment remain poorly defined. The Rho family GTPase Rac1/Rac2 has previously been implicated in cell functions involved in HPC maintenance, including adhesion, migration, homing, and mobilization. In the present studies we have identified R-Ras, a member of the Ras family, as a key signal mediator required for Rac1/Rac2 activation. We found that whereas Rac1 activity is up-regulated upon stem cell factor, integrin, or CXCL12 stimulation, R-Ras activity is inversely up-regulated. Expression of a constitutively active R-Ras mutant resulted in down-regulation of Rac1-activity whereas deletion of R-Ras led to an increase in Rac1/Rac2 activity and signaling. R-Ras−/− HPCs displayed a constitutively assembled cortical actin structure and showed increased directional migration. Rac1/Rac2 inhibition reversed the migration phenotype of R-Ras−/− HPCs, similar to that by expressing an R-Ras active mutant. Furthermore, R-Ras−/− mice showed enhanced responsiveness to G-CSF for HPC mobilization and exhibited decreased bone marrow homing. Transplantation experiments indicate that the R-Ras deficiency-induced HPC mobilization is a HPC intrinsic property. These results indicate that R-Ras is a critical regulator of Rac signaling required for HPC migration, homing, and mobilization.},

	abstract = {CD109 is a monomeric cell surface glycoprotein of 170 kD that is expressed on endothelial cells, activated but not resting T-lymphocytes, activated but not resting platelets, leukemic megakaryoblasts, and a subpopulation of bone marrow CD34+ cells. Observing an apparent association between CD109 expression and the megakaryocyte lineage (MK), we sought to determine whether CD109 was expressed on MK progenitors. In fetal bone marrow (FBM), a rich source of MK progenitors, CD109 is expressed on a mean of 11\% of CD34- cells. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of FBM CD34+ cells into CD109+ and CD109- fractions revealed that the CD34+CD109+ subset contained virtually all assayable MK progenitors, including the colony-forming unit-MK (CFU-MK) and the more primitive burst-forming unit-MK (BFU-MK). The CD34+CD109+ subset also contained all the assayable burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E), 90\% of the colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), and all of the more primitive mixed lineage colony-forming units (CFU-mix). In contrast, phenotypic analysis of the CD34+CD109- cells in FBM, adult bone marrow (ABM) and cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) demonstrated that this subset comprises lymphoid-committed progenitors, predominantly of the B-cell lineage. CD109 was expressed on the brightest CD34 cells identifiable not only in FBM, but also in ABM and MPB indicating that the most primitive, candidate hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) might also be contained in the CD109+ subset. In long-term marrow cultures of FBM CD34+ cells, all assayable cobblestone area forming cell (CAFC) activity was contained within the CD109+ cell subset. Further phenotypic analysis of the CD34+CD109+ fraction in ABM indicated that this subset included candidate HSCs that stain poorly with CD38, but express Thy-1 (CD90) and AC133 antigens, and efflux the mitochondrial dye Rhodamine 123 (Rho123). When selected CD34+ cells were sorted for CD109 expression and Rho123 staining, virtually all CAFC activity was found in the CD109+ fraction that stained most poorly with Rho123. CD34+ cells were also sorted into Thy-1 CD109+ and Thy-1 CD109+ fractions and virtually all the CAFC activity was found in the Thy-1+CD109+ subset. In contrast, the Thy-1-CD109+ fraction contained most of the short-term colony-forming cell (CFC) activity. CD109, therefore, is an antigen expressed on a subset of CD34+ cells that includes pluripotent HSCs as well as all classes of MK and myelo-erythroid progenitors. In combination with Thy-1, CD109 can be used to identify and separate myelo-erythroid and all classes of MK progenitors from candidate HSCs.},

Here, we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of all 48 members of the NKL homeobox gene subclass in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and during lymphopoiesis, identifying activities of nine particular genes. Four of these were expressed in HSPCs (HHEX, HLX1, NKX2-3 and NKX3-1) and three in common lymphoid progenitors (HHEX, HLX1 and MSX1). Interestingly, our data indicated downregulation of NKL homeobox gene transcripts in late progenitors and mature T-cells, a phenomenon which might explain the oncogenic impact of this group of genes in T-ALL. Using MSX1-expressing T-ALL cell lines as models, we showed that HHEX activates while HLX1, NKX2-3 and NKX3-1 repress MSX1 transcription, demonstrating the mutual regulation and differential activities of these homeobox genes. Analysis of a public T-ALL expression profiling data set comprising 117 patient samples identified 20 aberrantly activated members of the NKL subclass, extending the number of known NKL homeobox oncogene candidates. While 7/20 genes were also active during hematopoiesis, the remaining 13 showed ectopic expression. Finally, comparative analyses of T-ALL patient and cell line profiling data of NKL-positive and NKL-negative samples indicated absence of shared target genes but instead highlighted deregulation of apoptosis as common oncogenic effect. Taken together, we present a comprehensive survey of NKL homeobox genes in early hematopoiesis, T-cell development and T-ALL, showing that these genes generate an NKL-code for the diverse stages of lymphoid development which might be fundamental for regular differentiation.},

	abstract = {Objective
The Hox gene family of transcription factors is thought to be involved in the regulation of primitive hematopoietic cells, including stem cells and early committed progenitors, and has also been directly implicated in leukemia. To gain further insight into Hox gene–mediated regulation of hematopoiesis, we investigated the expression pattern of representative Hox genes and two of their cofactors, Pbx1 and Meis1, at different stages of murine hematopoiesis
Methods
Functionally distinct subpopulations of murine bone marrow (BM) and fetal liver day 14.5 (FL) cells were isolated by flow cytometry, and gene expression of various homeobox-containing genes was assessed by global cDNA amplification technique.
Results
Hox genes were found preferentially expressed in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)–enriched subpopulations and downregulated following differentiation and maturation. This profile of expression was observed at both adult and fetal stages of hematopoiesis. The Pbx1 and Meis1 genes had important differences in their expression pattern but were both detected in Hox expressing subpopulations. In particular, Meis1 consistently showed an expression profile closely resembling that of Hox genes. Finally, using the in vitro embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation model to mimic embryonic hematopoiesis, we found coexpression of Hox genes and their cofactors coincided with the appearance of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
Conclusion
Together, these results further support the notion that Hox genes are involved in the regulation of early hematopoietic cells and provide strong evidence that they are involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis throughout ontogeny.},

Because more than 80 fusion partners have been identified to date, the molecular functions of MLL fusion protein complexes appear diverse. However, over the past decade, the common functions utilized for leukemic transformation have begun to be elucidated. It appears that most (if not all) MLL fusion protein complexes utilize the AF4/ENL/P-TEFb and DOT1L complexes to some extent. Based on an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, several molecular targeting drugs are being developed, opening paths to novel therapies. Here, we review the recent progress made in identifying the molecular functions of various MLL fusions and categorize the numerous fusion partners into several functionally-distinct groups to help discern commonalities and differences among various MLL fusion protein complexes.},

BCP-ALL patients carrying any of the recurrent translocations ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL or TCF3-PBX1 harbored few mutations in driver genes compared to other BCP-ALL patients. Specifically in BCP-ALL, we identified ATRX as a novel putative driver gene and uncovered an association between somatic mutations in the Notch signaling pathway at ALL diagnosis and increased risk of relapse. Furthermore, we identified EP300, ARID1A and SH2B3 as relapse-associated genes. The genes highlighted in our study were frequently involved in epigenetic regulation, associated with germline susceptibility to ALL, and present in minor subclones at diagnosis that became dominant at relapse. We observed a high degree of clonal heterogeneity and evolution between diagnosis and relapse in both BCP-ALL and T-ALL, which could have implications for the treatment efficiency.},

              RUNX1 can act as an activator and repressor during megakaryocytic differentiation and counteracts the activity of TAL1.
            
          
        , The activity of antagonizing transcription factors represents a mechanistic paradigm of bidirectional lineage–fate control during hematopoiesis. At the megakaryocytic/erythroid bifurcation, the crossantagonism of krueppel-like factor 1 (KLF1) and friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1) has such a decisive role. However, how this antagonism is resolved during lineage specification is poorly understood. We found that runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) inhibits erythroid differentiation of murine megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors and primary human CD34+ progenitor cells. We show that RUNX1 represses the erythroid gene expression program during megakaryocytic differentiation by epigenetic repression of the erythroid master regulator KLF1. RUNX1 binding to the KLF1 locus is increased during megakaryocytic differentiation and counterbalances the activating role of T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1). We found that corepressor recruitment by RUNX1 contributes to a block of the KLF1-dependent erythroid gene expression program. Our data indicate that the repressive function of RUNX1 influences the balance between erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation by shifting the balance between KLF1 and FLI1 in the direction of FLI1. Taken together, we show that RUNX1 is a key player within a network of transcription factors that represses the erythroid gene expression program.},

Adaptive CD3−CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+ NK cells exhibited metabolic hallmarks of lymphocyte memory, including increased oxidative mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and spare respiratory capacity. Mechanistically, we found that a short isoform of the chromatin-modifying transcriptional regulator, AT-rich interaction domain 5B (ARID5B), was selectively induced through DNA hypomethylation in adaptive NK cells. Knockdown and overexpression studies demonstrated that ARID5B played a direct role in promoting mitochondrial membrane potential, expression of genes encoding electron transport chain components, oxidative metabolism, survival, and IFN-γ production.

Dysregulation of the IFN response results in inflammatory diseases and chronic infections. In this study, we demonstrate that IFN regulatory factor 2 (IRF2), an ISG and a negative regulator of IFN signaling, influences alphavirus neuroinvasion and pathogenesis. A Sindbis virus strain that in wild-type (WT) mice only causes disease when injected into the brain leads to lethal encephalitis in Irf2−/− mice after peripheral inoculation. Irf2−/− mice fail to control virus replication and recruit immune infiltrates into the brain. Reduced B cells and virus-specific IgG are observed in the Irf2−/− mouse brains despite the presence of peripheral neutralizing antibodies, suggesting a defect in B cell trafficking to the central nervous system (CNS). B cell–deficient μMT mice are significantly more susceptible to viral infection, yet WT B cells and serum are unable to rescue the Irf2−/− mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that proper localization of B cells and local production of antibodies in the CNS are required for protection.

Our purpose here was to examine whether HNSCCs selected for resistance to cisplatin fail to exhibit Casp9 activation in response to cisplatin. The cisplatin-resistant HNSCCs (HSC-2CR) were selected from cisplatin-sensitive HNSCCs (HSC-2) for growth in the presence of cisplatin. Following cisplatin treatment, protelyzed Casp9 subunits were detected in HSC-2, but not detected in HSC-2CR. Using a direct enzymatic assay measuring cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrate (LEHD-AFC), Casp9 activity in cisplatin-treated HSC-2CR was less than that in cisplatin-treated HSC-2. Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) has been shown to participate as an adaptor molecule in Casp9 activation. In the presence of cytochrome c (Cyt c) released from mitochondria, Apaf-1 binds to Casp9 and causes its activation. HSC-2 expressed 2-fold higher levels of Apaf-1 compared with HSC-2CR. On the other hand, following cisplatin treatment, the same degree of increase in cytoplasmic Cyt c was detected in both HSC-2 and HSC-2CR. These results suggest that in a certain type of HNSCCs, the inhibition of Casp9 activity and Apaf-1 expression may represent a mechanism of acquired cisplatin resistance.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genotyping of the CASP9 (rs1052576) polymorphism were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction for blood samples of prostate cancer patients (n=69) and controls (n=76).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in the frequency of CASP9 genotypes (χ2=1.363; p=0.506). Patients with CASP9 (rs1052576) CT genotype were 12.8 fold higher in pathological stage of pT2a compared to any other stages of cancer (OR=0.078, 95\% CI= 0.009-0.062; p=0.004). Also TT genotype carriers were 11.3 times lower in pathological stage of pT2a (OR=11.33, 95\% CI=2.39-53.748; p=0.000). C allele carriers were 11.36 fold higher in pathological stage of pT2a compared to any other stages of cancer (OR=0.088, 95\% CI=0.019-0.418; p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: CASP9 (rs1052576) C allele was decreasing the risk for pathological stage of patients with prostate cancer and also CT genotype had positive impact on pathological stage of patients with prostate cancer. CASP9 (rs1052576) TT genotype was seemed to be associated with higher risk of pathological stage.

Caspase 9 (CASP9) plays a central role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of caspase 9 gene polymorphism in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 96 NSCLC cases and 67 controls. CASP9 Ex5+32 G{\textgreater}A polymorphism was investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the groups in the frequency of CASP9 genotypes (p=0.008). The number of the carriers of the ancestral GG genotype, was significantly higher in the NSCLC group than in the control (p=0.009). The heterozygote GA genotype and mutant A allele frequency were significantly higher in the control group compared to the NSCLC group (p=0.005, p=0.009, respectively). Serum CASP9 levels were significantly lower in the patients group than in the control group (p{\textless}0.0001).
CONCLUSION: CASP9 Ex5+32 GG genotype was a risk factor whereas the variant A allele could be a risk-reducing factor for NSCLC.},

METHOD: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to analyse caspase-9 mRNA expression in cancer tissue and corresponding normal mucosa from 120 patients.
RESULTS: Compared with normal mucosa, the expression of caspase-9 mRNA was found to be downregulated in cancer tissue (P = 0.001). Poorly differentiated cancer showed lower mRNA expression than cancer with greater differentiation (P = 0.031). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with downregulated caspase-9 showed a worse overall survival (P = 0.012) and disease-free survival (P = 0.022). Cox's proportional hazards regression model confirmed that expression of caspase-9 was the strongest prognostic factor in stage II colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSION: The mRNA expression of caspase-9 can be used as an independent prognostic factor for patients with stage II colorectal cancer.},

This study was aimed to analyze percentage of apoptosis and apoptosis mediated through the intrinsic pathway with clinical outcomes in patients with pediatric AML. Methods This prospective study included pediatric AML patients enrolled from July 2013 to August 2016. Annexin-V (marker of total apoptosis) and caspase-9 expression (marker of intrinsic pathway) was determined in baseline bone marrow (BM) samples by flow cytometery and compared with controls (unaffected BM of solid tumors and peripheral blood [PB] of unaffected siblings). Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using log-rank test. Results A total of 151 AML patients were enrolled, median age 10 (range: 0.7-18 years). Annexin-V expression in blast cells was significantly high in AML patients as compared to BM of subjects with solid tumors (P = 0.01) and PB of healthy subjects (P = 0.04). Caspase-9 expression in blast cells was not significantly different. Median annexin-V expression was significantly higher in patients with WBC count ≥11 000/mm3 (P = 0.02), poor-risk cytogenetics (P = 0.02), the absence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 translocation (P = 0.004), and the absence of NPM1 mutation (P = 0.05). Patients with high annexin-V expression had significantly inferior OS (P = 0.05) in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis (P = 0.32). Conclusion Apoptosis as a whole was found to be activated in baseline BM samples of AML patients. High apoptosis may be associated with high-risk phenotype in this disease.},

Here, we immunopurified proteins associated with ENL, a protein commonly fused to MLL. Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR). The composition of EAP was further verified by coimmunoprecipitation, 2-hybrid analysis, pull-down, and colocalization experiments. Purified EAP showed a histone H3 lysine 79-specific methylase activity, displayed a robust RNAPolII CTD kinase function, and counteracted the effect of the pTEFb inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-benzimidazole-riboside. In vivo, an ENL knock-down diminished genome-wide as well as gene-specific H3K79 dimethylation, reduced global run-on elongation, and inhibited transient transcriptional reporter activity. According to structure-function data, DOT1L recruitment was important for transformation by the MLL-ENL fusion derivative. These results suggest a function of ENL in histone modification and transcriptional elongation.},

Furthermore, MLL-AF6, an MLL fusion with a cytoplasmic protein, does not form such hybrid complexes, but nevertheless constitutively recruits AEP to target chromatin via unknown alternative mechanisms. Thus, AEP recruitment is an integral part of both physiological and pathological MLL-dependent transcriptional pathways.

	abstract = {Cancer is a disease arising from both genetic and epigenetic modifications of DNA that contribute to changes in gene expression in the cell. Genetic modifications include loss or amplification of DNA, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) as well as gene mutations. Epigenetic changes in cancer are generally thought to be brought about by alterations in DNA and histone modifications that lead to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes and the activation of oncogenic genes. Other consequences that result from epigenetic changes, such as inappropriate expression or repression of some genes in the wrong cellular context, can also result in the alteration of control and physiological systems such that a normal cell becomes tumorigenic. Excessive levels of the enzymes that act as epigenetic modifiers have been reported as markers of aggressive breast cancer and are associated with metastatic progression. It is likely that this is a common contributor to the recurrence and spread of the disease. The emphasis on genetic changes, for example in genome-wide association studies and increasingly in whole genome sequencing analyses of tumours, has resulted in the importance of epigenetic changes having less attention until recently. Epigenetic alterations at both the DNA and histone level are increasingly being recognised as playing a role in tumourigenesis. Recent studies have found that distinct subgroups of poor-prognosis tumours lack genetic alterations but are epigenetically deregulated, pointing to the important role that epigenetic modifications and/or their modifiers may play in cancer. In this review, we highlight the multitude of epigenetic changes that can occur and will discuss how deregulation of epigenetic modifiers contributes to cancer progression. We also discuss the off-target effects that epigenetic modifiers may have, notably the effects that histone modifiers have on non-histone proteins that can modulate protein expression and activity, as well as the role of hypoxia in epigenetic regulation.},

	abstract = {Choice of a T lymphoid fate by hematopoietic progenitor cells depends on sustained Notch-Delta signaling combined with tightly regulated activities of multiple transcription factors. To dissect the regulatory network connections that mediate this process, we have used high-resolution analysis of regulatory gene expression trajectories from the beginning to the end of specification, tests of the short-term Notch dependence of these gene expression changes, and analyses of the effects of overexpression of two essential transcription factors, namely PU.1 and GATA-3. Quantitative expression measurements of {\textgreater}50 transcription factor and marker genes have been used to derive the principal components of regulatory change through which T cell precursors progress from primitive multipotency to T lineage commitment. Our analyses reveal separate contributions of Notch signaling, GATA-3 activity, and down-regulation of PU.1. Using BioTapestry (www.BioTapestry.org), the results have been assembled into a draft gene regulatory network for the specification of T cell precursors and the choice of T as opposed to myeloid/dendritic or mast-cell fates. This network also accommodates effects of E proteins and mutual repression circuits of Gfi1 against Egr-2 and of TCF-1 against PU.1 as proposed elsewhere, but requires additional functions that remain unidentified. Distinctive features of this network structure include the intense dose dependence of GATA-3 effects, the gene-specific modulation of PU.1 activity based on Notch activity, the lack of direct opposition between PU.1 and GATA-3, and the need for a distinct, late-acting repressive function or functions to extinguish stem and progenitor-derived regulatory gene expression.},

The double-negative feedback loop between CCA1/LHY and PRR5/TOC1 generates a bistable, hysteretic behavior in the Arabidopsis circadian clock. We found that the IFFL involving PRR9/7 breaks the bistability and moves the system forward with a rapid pulse in the daytime, and the evening complex (EC) breaks it in the evening. With this illustration, we can intuitively explain the behavior of the clock under mutant conditions.

We study high quality GRNs consisting of undirected protein–protein, genetic and homologous interactions, and directed protein–DNA, regulatory and miRNA–mRNA interactions in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our data-integration framework integrates interactions in composite network motifs, clusters these in biologically relevant, higher-order topological network motif modules, overlays these with gene expression profiles and discovers novel connections between modules and regulators. Similar modules exist in the integrated GRNs of worm and plant. We show how experimental or computational methodologies underlying a certain data type impact network topology. Through phylogenetic decomposition, we found that proteins of worm and plant tend to functionally interact with proteins of a similar age, while at the regulatory level TFs favor same age, but also older target genes. Despite some influence of the duplication mode difference, we also observe at the motif and module level for both species a preference for age homogeneity for undirected and age heterogeneity for directed interactions. This leads to a model where novel genes are added together to the GRNs in a specific biological functional context, regulated by one or more TFs that also target older genes in the GRNs. Overall, we detected topological, functional and evolutionary properties of GRNs that are potentially universal in all species.},

A number of publications have recently examined the occurrence and properties of the feed-forward motif in a variety of networks, including those that are of interest in genome biology, such as gene networks. The present work looks in some detail at the dynamics of the bi-fan motif, using systems of ordinary differential equations to model the populations of transcription factors, mRNA and protein, with the aim of extending our understanding of what appear to be important building blocks of gene network structure.

Results
We develop an ordinary differential equation model of the bi-fan motif and analyse variants of the motif corresponding to its behaviour under various conditions. In particular, we examine the effects of different steady and pulsed inputs to five variants of the bifan motif, based on evidence in the literature of bifan motifs found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (commonly known as baker's yeast). Using this model, we characterize the dynamical behaviour of the bi-fan motif for a wide range of biologically plausible parameters and configurations. We find that there is no characteristic behaviour for the motif, and with the correct choice of parameters and of internal structure, very different, indeed even opposite behaviours may be obtained.

Conclusion
Even with this relatively simple model, the bi-fan motif can exhibit a wide range of dynamical responses. This suggests that it is difficult to gain significant insights into biological function simply by considering the connection architecture of a gene network, or its decomposition into simple structural motifs. It is necessary to supplement such structural information by kinetic parameters, or dynamic time series experimental data, both of which are currently difficult to obtain.},

	abstract = {Sensory transcription networks generally control rapid and reversible gene expression responses to external stimuli. Developmental transcription networks carry out slow and irreversible temporal programs of gene expression during development. It is important to understand the design principles that underlie the structure of sensory and developmental transcription networks. Cascades, which are chains of regulatory reactions, are a basic structural element of transcription networks. When comparing databases of sensory and developmental transcription networks, a striking difference is found in the distribution of cascade lengths. Here, we suggest that delay times in the responses of the network present a design constraint that influences the network architecture. We experimentally studied the response times in simple cascades constructed of well-characterized repressors in Escherichia coli. Accurate kinetics at high temporal resolution was measured using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters. We find that transcription cascades can show long delays of about one cell-cycle time per cascade step. Mathematical analysis suggests that such a delay is characteristic of cascades that are designed to minimize the response times for both turning-on and turning-off gene expression. The need to achieve rapid reversible responses in sensory transcription networks may help explain the finding that long cascades are very rare in databases of E.coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae sensory transcription networks. In contrast, long cascades are common in developmental transcription networks from sea urchin and from Drosophila melanogaster. Response delay constraints are likely to be less important for developmental networks, since they control irreversible processes on the timescale of cell-cycles. This study highlights a fundamental difference between the architecture of sensory and developmental transcription networks.},

The yeast Dot1 and its human counterpart, hDOT1L, methylate lysine 79 located within the globular domain of histone H3. Here we report that hDOT1L interacts with AF10, an MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) fusion partner involved in acute myeloid leukemia, through the OM-LZ region of AF10 required for MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis. We demonstrate that direct fusion of hDOT1L to MLL results in leukemic transformation in an hDOT1L methyltransferase activity-dependent manner. Transformation by MLL-hDOT1L and MLL-AF10 results in upregulation of a number of leukemia-relevant genes, such as Hoxa9, concomitant with hypermethylation of H3-K79. Our studies thus establish that mistargeting of hDOT1L to Hoxa9 plays an important role in MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis and suggests that the enzymatic activity of hDOT1L may provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention.},

Patients carrying MLL-FPs have very few cooperating mutations, making MLL-FP driven leukemias ideal for animal modeling. The fact that the MLL-FP is the main driver mutation has allowed for a wide range of different experimental model systems designed to explore different aspects of MLL-FP leukemogenesis. In addition, MLL-FP driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice is often used as a general model for AML. This review provides an overview of different MLL-FP mouse model systems and discusses how well they have recapitulated aspects of the human disease as well as highlights the biological insights each model has provided into MLL-FP leukemogenesis. Many promising new drugs fail in the early stages of clinical trials.

The lines synthesized cytoplasmic lambda-chain, but had no detectable surface immunoglobulins. Fc receptors and complement receptors could not be detected in either line. The lines had very complex chromosomal abnormalities, but the patterns of chromosomes differed greatly between the two lines. The two lines, together with the RPMI 8226 line established by Matsuoka et al. (1967), were analyzed for phenotypic expression as defined by a panel of monoclonal antibodies to B cells (B1, BA-1, BA-2, BA-3, OKIa-1 and OKT10/BMA0100). Neither OPM-1 nor OPM-2 reacted with any of the antibodies tested except OKT10. OPM-1 cells reacted weakly (less than 30\%) with OKT10/BMA0100, while OPM-2 cells showed a fluctuating reactivity, ranging from 40 to 80\%, with OKT10/BMA0100. In contrast, RPMI 8226 reacted strongly with OKT10 and BA-2. These results demonstrate the presence of phenotypic heterogeneity in all 3 myeloma cell lines, suggesting that the lines might represent different stages of terminal B-cell development.},

The most common MLL mutation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the t(4;11)(q21;q23) chromosome translocation that fuses MLL in-frame with the AF4 gene producing MLL-AF4 and AF4-MLL fusion proteins. Previously, we found that MLL-AF4 binds to the BCL-2 gene and directly activates it through DOT1L recruitment and increased H3K79me2/3 levels. In the study described here, we performed a detailed analysis of MLL-AF4 regulation of the entire BCL-2 family. By measuring nascent RNA production in MLL-AF4 knockdowns, we found that of all the BCL-2 family genes, MLL-AF4 directly controls the active transcription of both BCL-2 and MCL-1 and also represses BIM via binding of the polycomb group repressor 1 (PRC1) complex component CBX8. We further analyzed MLL-AF4 activation of the BCL-2 gene using Capture-C and identified a BCL-2-specific enhancer, consisting of two clusters of H3K27Ac at the 3′ end of the gene. Loss of MLL-AF4 activity results in a reduction of H3K79me3 levels in the gene body and H3K27Ac levels at the 3′ BCL-2 enhancer, revealing a novel regulatory link between these two histone marks and MLL-AF4-mediated activation of BCL-2.,

The pathogenesis of t(4;11)/KMT2A-AFF1+ (MLL-AF4+) infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains difficult to model, and the pathogenic contribution in cancer of the reciprocal fusions resulting from derivative translocated-chromosomes remains obscure. Here, “multi-layered” genome-wide analyses and validation were performed on a total of 124 de novo cases of infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia uniformly diagnosed and treated according to the Interfant 99/06 protocol. These patients showed the most silent mutational landscape reported so far for any sequenced pediatric cancer. Recurrent mutations were exclusively found in K-RAS and N-RAS, were subclonal and were frequently lost at relapse, despite a larger number of non-recurrent/non-silent mutations. Unlike non-MLL-rearranged B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, B-cell receptor repertoire analysis revealed minor, non-expanded B-cell clones in t(4;11)+ infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and RNA-sequencing showed transcriptomic similarities between t(4;11)+ infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and the most immature human fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, confirming a “pre-VDJ” fetal cellular origin for both t(4;11) and RASmut. The reciprocal fusion AF4-MLL was expressed in only 45\% (19/43) of the t(4;11)+ patients, and HOXA cluster genes are exclusively expressed in AF4-MLL-expressing patients. Importantly, AF4-MLL/HOXA-expressing patients had a significantly better 4-year event-free survival (62.4\% vs. 11.7\%, P=0.001), and overall survival (73.7 vs. 25.2\%, P=0.016). AF4-MLL expression retained its prognostic significance when analyzed in a Cox model adjusting for risk stratification according to the Interfant-06 protocol based on age at diagnosis, white blood cell count and response to prednisone.

Here, we report that six additional caspases (caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10) are processed in cell-free extracts in response to cytochrome c, and that three others (caspases-1, -4, and -5) failed to be activated under the same conditions.

Depletion of caspase-9 from cell extracts abrogated cytochrome c-inducible activation of caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10, suggesting that caspase-9 is required for all of these downstream caspase activation events. Immunodepletion of caspases-3, -6, and -7 from cell extracts enabled us to order the sequence of caspase activation events downstream of caspase-9 and reveal the presence of a branched caspase cascade. Caspase-3 is required for the activation of four other caspases (-2, -6, -8, and -10) in this pathway and also participates in a feedback amplification loop involving caspase-9.},

	abstract = {Ikaros family DNA-binding proteins are critical regulators of B-cell development. Because the current knowledge of Ikaros targets in B-cell progenitors is limited, we have identified genes that are bound and regulated by Ikaros in pre-B cells. To elucidate the role of Ikaros in B-cell lineage specification and differentiation, we analyzed the differential expression of Ikaros targets during the progression of multipotent to lymphoid-restricted progenitors, B- and T-cell lineage specification, and progression along the B-cell lineage. Ikaros targets accounted for one-half of all genes up-regulated during B-cell lineage specification in vivo, explaining the essential role of Ikaros in this process. Expression of the Ikaros paralogs Ikzf1 and Ikzf3 increases incrementally during B-cell progenitor differentiation, and, remarkably, inducible Ikaros expression in cycling pre-B cells was sufficient to drive transcriptional changes resembling the differentiation of cycling to resting pre-Bcells in vivo. The data suggest that Ikaros transcription factor dosage drives the progression of progenitors along a predetermined lineage by regulating multiple targets in key pathways, including pre-B–cell receptor signaling, cell cycle progression, and lymphocyte receptor rearrangement.Our approachmay be of general use to map the contribution of transcription factors to cell lineage commitment and differentiation.},

A cascade of lineage-affiliated gene expression signatures, primed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and differentially propagated in lineage-restricted progenitors, is identified. First evidence is provided for a stochastic sampling of lymphoid, erythroid and myeloid transcripts in HSC and multipotent progenitors (MPP). Multi-lineage priming is subsequently resolved upon lineage restrictions. Nonetheless, an unexpected association of lymphoid and myeloid signatures is detected past a nominal myeloid restriction point and a previously unappreciated lymphoid potential is revealed for this stage in development. New insight is provided into Ikaros' role as a bivalent regulator of multi-lineage priming during early hematopoiesis. Whereas Ikaros is responsible for activation of a cascade of lymphoid signatures in the HSC, at subsequent restriction points it is also involved in the repression of lineage-inappropriate signatures including stem cell-specific genes.},

The lack of NK cells and some gamma delta T cell subsets and a large reduction in thymic dendritic APCs suggest that Ikaros is essential for establishing early branch points in the postnatal T cell pathway. The lymphoid defects detected in Ikaros null mice reveal critical molecular differences between fetal and postnatal hematopoietic progenitors that dictate their ability to give rise to T cells.

	abstract = {Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) is essential for homing and maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells in distinct stromal cell niches within the marrow. Chemotactic responsiveness of haematopoietic stem cells is restricted to the ligand for CXCR4, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), which is constitutively secreted by marrow stromal cells. Myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia cells also express CXCR4 that induces leukaemia cell chemotaxis and migration beneath marrow stromal cells. CXCR4 expression levels have a major prognostic impact in acute myeloid leukaemia. There is growing in vitro and in vivo evidence that CXCR4 expression by leukaemia cells allows for homing and their retention within the marrow. As such, leukaemia cells appear to utilise CXCR4 to access niches that are normally restricted to progenitor cells, and thereby reside in a microenvironment that favours their growth and survival. CXCR4- and integrin-mediated contact between leukaemia cells and stromal cells protects leukaemia cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced cell death and therefore may represent a mechanism to explain minimal residual disease and subsequent relapses commonly seen in the treatment of these diseases. This review summarises our current knowledge regarding the importance of CXCR4 in acute and chronic leukaemia, discusses the importance of CXCR4 detection by flow cytometry in the diagnostic workup of leukaemia patients, and introduces the potential role of CXCR4-targeting compounds for the treatment of leukaemia patients.},

	abstract = {Bone marrow engraftment in the context of hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor (HSC/P) transplantation is based on the ability of intravenously administered cells to lodge in the medullary cavity and be retained in the appropriate marrow space, a process referred to as homing. It is likely that homing is a multistep process, encompassing a sequence of highly regulated events that mimic the migration of leukocytes to inflammatory sites. In leukocyte biology, this process includes an initial phase of tethering and rolling of cells to the endothelium via E‐ and P‐selectins, firm adhesion to the vessel wall via integrins that appear to be activated in an “inside‐out” fashion, transendothelial migration, and chemotaxis through the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the inflammatory nidus. For HSC/P, the cells appear to migrate to the endosteal space of the bone marrow. A second phase of engraftment involves the subsequent interaction of specific HSC/P surface receptors, such as α4β1 integrin receptors with vascular cell–cell adhesion molecule‐1 and fibronectin in the ECM, and interactions with growth factors that are soluble, membrane, or matrix bound. We have utilized knockout and conditional knockout mouse lines generated by gene targeting to study the role of Rac1 and Rac2 in blood cell development and function. We have determined that Rac is activated via stimulation of CXCR4 by SDF‐1, by adhesion via β1 integrins, and via stimulation of c‐kit by the stem cell factor—all of which involved in stem cell engraftment. Thus Rac proteins are key molecular switches of HSC/P engraftment and marrow retention. We have defined Rac proteins as key regulators of HSC/P cell function and delineated key unique and overlapping functions of these two highly related GTPases in a variety of primary hematopoietic cell lineages in vitro and in vivo. Further, we have begun to define the mechanisms by which each GTPase leads to specific functions in these cells. These studies have led to important new understanding of stem cell bone marrow retention and trafficking in the peripheral circulation and to the development of a novel small molecule inhibitor that can modulate stem cell functions, including adhesion, mobilization, and proliferation. This chapter describes the biochemical footprint of stem cell engraftment and marrow retention related to Rho GTPases. In addition, it reviews abnormalities of Rho GTPases implicated in human immunohematopoietic diseases and in leukemia/lymphoma.},

We have previously reported the potent sensitivity of many high-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) xenografts to navitoclax. Given the superior tolerability of venetoclax, here we have investigated its efficacy in childhood ALL. We demonstrate that in contrast to the clear dependence of CLL on BCL-2 alone, effective antileukemic activity in the majority of ALL xenografts requires concurrent inhibition of both BCL-2 and BCL-XL We identify BCL-XL expression as a key predictor of poor response to venetoclax and demonstrate that concurrent inhibition of both BCL-2 and BCL-XL results in synergistic killing in the majority of ALL xenografts. A notable exception is mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged infant ALL, where venetoclax largely recapitulates the activity of navitoclax, identifying this subgroup of patients as potential candidates for clinical trials of venetoclax in childhood ALL.

Pooled libraries of CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting human protein-coding genes and encoded in viral vectors have been used to systematically create gene knockouts in a variety of human cancer and immortalized cell lines, in an effort to identify whether these knockouts cause cellular fitness defects. Previous work has shown that CRISPR screens are more sensitive and specific than pooled-library shRNA screens in similar assays, but currently there exists significant variability across CRISPR library designs and experimental protocols. In this study, we reanalyze 17 genome-scale knockout screens in human cell lines from three research groups, using three different genome-scale gRNA libraries. Using the Bayesian Analysis of Gene Essentiality algorithm to identify essential genes, we refine and expand our previously defined set of human core essential genes from 360 to 684 genes. We use this expanded set of reference core essential genes, CEG2, plus empirical data from six CRISPR knockout screens to guide the design of a sequence-optimized gRNA library, the Toronto KnockOut version 3.0 (TKOv3) library. We then demonstrate the high effectiveness of the library relative to reference sets of essential and nonessential genes, as well as other screens using similar approaches. The optimized TKOv3 library, combined with the CEG2 reference set, provide an efficient, highly optimized platform for performing and assessing gene knockout screens in human cell lines.},

Both the lymphoblasts of the patient and the cells of the cell line SEM showed the t(4;11) chromosomal rearrangement. The analysis of the immunophenotype of the SEM cell line revealed the B-cell differentiation antigens CD19, CD22 and CDw75 in the absence of CD20, CD24 and immunoglobulin expression. Besides B-lineage antigens, SEM cells were positive for the myeloid antigens CD13, CD15, CD33 and CDw65. Immunogenotypic analysis of SEM cells showed a monoclonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH). T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma and delta genes. Addition of interleukin (IL)-7 promoted the growth of the patient's lymphoblasts in culture and enhanced the proliferation of SEM cells. The SEM cells also express messenger RNA (mRNA) for the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R), but no evidence for autocrine production of IL-7 by the cell line was found. Addition of IL-4, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-alpha, or IFN-gamma resulted in a profound inhibition of SEM growth. Thus, these cytokines may have important growth regulatory activities for biphenotypic leukaemic ALL cells.},

	abstract = {The pathogenesis of infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is still not well defined. Short latency to leukemia and very high concordance rate for ALL in Mixed-Lineage Leukemia (MLL)-positive infant twins suggest that the MLL rearrangement itself could be sufficient for overt leukemia. Attempts to generate a suitable mouse model for MLL-AF4-positive ALL did not thoroughly resolve the issue of whether cooperating mutations are required to reduce latency and to generate overt leukemia in vivo. In this study, we applied single-nucleotide polymorphism array technology to perform genomic profiling of 28 infant ALL cases carrying t(4;11) to detect MLL-cooperating aberrations hidden to conventional techniques and to gain new insights into infant ALL pathogenesis. In contrast to pediatric, adolescent and adult ALL cases, the MLL rearrangement in infant ALL is associated with an exceptionally low frequency of copy-number abnormalities, thus confirming the unique nature of this disease. By contrast, additional genetic aberrations are acquired at disease relapse. Small-segmental uniparental disomy traits were frequently detected, mostly constitutional, and widely distributed throughout the genome. It can be argued that the MLL rearrangement as a first hit, rather than inducing the acquisition of additional genetic lesions, has a major role to drive and hasten the onset of leukemia.},

We used long-distance inverse-polymerase chain reaction to characterize the chromosomal rearrangement of individual acute leukemia patients. We present data of the molecular characterization of 1590 MLL-rearranged biopsy samples obtained from acute leukemia patients. The precise localization of genomic breakpoints within the MLL gene and the involved translocation partner genes (TPGs) were determined and novel TPGs identified. All patients were classified according to their gender (852 females and 745 males), age at diagnosis (558 infant, 416 pediatric and 616 adult leukemia patients) and other clinical criteria. Combined data of our study and recently published data revealed a total of 121 different MLL rearrangements, of which 79 TPGs are now characterized at the molecular level. However, only seven rearrangements seem to be predominantly associated with illegitimate recombinations of the MLL gene (∼90\%): AFF1/AF4, MLLT3/AF9, MLLT1/ENL, MLLT10/AF10, ELL, partial tandem duplications (MLL PTDs) and MLLT4/AF6, respectively. The MLL breakpoint distributions for all clinical relevant subtypes (gender, disease type, age at diagnosis, reciprocal, complex and therapy-induced translocations) are presented.

	abstract = {Epigenetics is often defined as the study of heritable changes in gene expression or chromosome stability that don’t alter the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes are established through multiple mechanisms that include DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs and the covalent modification of specific residues on histone proteins. It is becoming clear not only that aberrant epigenetic changes are common in many human diseases such as leukemia, but that these changes by their very nature are malleable, and thus are amenable to treatment. Epigenetic based therapies have so far focused on the use of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which tend to have more general and widespread effects on gene regulation in the cell. However, if a unique molecular pathway can be identified, diseases caused by epigenetic mechanisms are excellent candidates for the development of more targeted therapies that focus on specific gene targets, individual binding domains, or specific enzymatic activities. Designing effective targeted therapies depends on a clear understanding of the role of epigenetic mutations during disease progression. The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) protein is an example of a developmentally important protein that controls the epigenetic activation of gene targets in part by methylating histone 3 on lysine 4. MLL is required for normal development, but is also mutated in a subset of aggressive human leukemias and thus provides a useful model for studying the link between epigenetic cell memory and human disease. The most common MLL mutations are chromosome translocations that fuse the MLL gene in frame with partner genes creating novel fusion proteins. In this review, we summarize recent work that argues MLL fusion proteins could function through a single molecular pathway, but we also highlight important data that suggests instead that multiple independent mechanisms underlie MLL mediated leukemogenesis.},

	abstract = {Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) reside in bone marrow niche and receive important signals from the microenvironment that support self‐renewal, maintain quiescence and endow LSC with the ability of chemotherapy resistance. Rac1 belongs to the small GTP‐binding protein superfamily and is implicated in the interactions of hematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow niche. Our previous studies have shown that Rac1 is over‐expressed in leukemia patients and activation of Rac1 GTPase is closely associated with the efficient migration of leukemia cells. However, the potential functions for Rac1 GTPase in LSCs behaviors and in the residence of leukemia cells in niche remain unknown. In this study, by forced expression of a dominant‐negative form of Rac1 GTPase in a CD34+ myeloid leukemia cell line, as well as bone marrow cells from leukemia patients, we show that inactivation of Rac1 GTPase causes impaired migration and enhances chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Inactivation of Rac1 in leukemia cells also lead to a reduction in the frequency of cells in quiescent state and inhibition of homing to bone marrow niche. Gene expression analysis shows that inactivation of Rac1 down‐regulates the expression of several cell intrinsic cell cycle inhibitors such as p21, p27, and p57, as well as the extrinsic molecules that mediated the interaction of LSC with osteoblastic niche. Furthermore, we show that Rac1 mediated the localization in niche is further attributed to the maintenance of quiescence. Our results provide evidence for the critical role of Rac1 GTPase in leukemia cell chemotherapy resistance, quiescence maintenance and the interaction with bone marrow microenvironment.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have established that during embryonic development, hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells are generated from hemogenic endothelium precursors through a process termed endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). The transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT. GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover, those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium.},

Our data show that infant MLL-R ALL has one of the lowest frequencies of somatic mutations of any sequenced cancer, with the predominant leukemic clone carrying a mean of 1.3 non-silent mutations. Despite this paucity of mutations, we detected activating mutations in kinase-PI3K-RAS signaling pathway components in 47\% of cases.

In contrast to infant cases, MLL-R leukemia in older children had more somatic mutations (mean of 6.5 mutations/case versus 1.3 mutations/case, P = 7.15 × 10(-5)) and had frequent mutations (45\%) in epigenetic regulators, a category of genes that, with the exception of MLL, was rarely mutated in infant MLL-R ALL.},

        , Rearrangements of the MLL gene define a genetically distinct subset of acute leukemias with poor prognosis. Current treatment options are of limited effectiveness; thus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this disease. Genetic and small molecule inhibitor studies have demonstrated that the histone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged leukemia in model systems. Here we describe the characterization of EPZ-5676, a potent and selective aminonucleoside inhibitor of DOT1L histone methyltransferase activity. The compound has an inhibition constant value of 80 pM, and demonstrates 37 000-fold selectivity over all other methyltransferases tested. In cellular studies, EPZ-5676 inhibited H3K79 methylation and MLL-fusion target gene expression and demonstrated potent cell killing that was selective for acute leukemia lines bearing MLL translocations. Continuous IV infusion of EPZ-5676 in a rat xenograft model of MLL-rearranged leukemia caused complete tumor regressions that were sustained well beyond the compound infusion period with no significant weight loss or signs of toxicity. EPZ-5676 is therefore a potential treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia and is under clinical investigation.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems such as biological and social systems can be modeled using graph structures called biological networks and social networks. Instead of studying separately each of the elements composing such complex systems, it is easier to study the networks representing the interactions between the elements of these systems. A commonly known fact in biological and social networks’ analysis is that in most networks some important or influential elements (e.g. essential proteins in PPI networks) are placed in some particular positions in a network. These positions (i.e. vertices) have some particular structural properties. Centrality measures quantify such facts from different points of view. Based on centrality measures the graph elements such as vertices and edges can be ranked from different points of view. Top ranked elements in the graph are supposed to play an important role in the network. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing different centrality measures and their applications in some biological networks such as Protein-Protein interaction network, residue interaction and gene–gene interaction networks.},

To examine the role of Runx1, we generated mesenchymal-cell-specific and chondrocyte-specific Runx1-deficient mice [Prx1 Runx1f/f mice and α1(II) Runx1f/f mice, respectively] to circumvent the embryonic lethality of Runx1-deficient mice. We then mated these mice with Runx2 mutant mice to obtain mesenchymal-cell-specific or chondrocyte-specific Runx1; Runx2 double-mutant mice [Prx1 DKO mice and α1(II) DKO mice, respectively]. Prx1 Runx1f/f mice displayed a delay in sternal development and Prx1 DKO mice completely lacked a sternum. By contrast, α1(II) Runx1f/f mice and α1(II) DKO mice did not show any abnormal sternal morphogenesis or chondrocyte differentiation. Notably, Runx1, Runx2 and the Prx1-Cre transgene were co-expressed specifically in the sternum, which explains the observation that the abnormalities were limited to the sternum. Histologically, mesenchymal cells condensed normally in the prospective sternum of Prx1 DKO mice; however, commitment to the chondrocyte lineage, which follows mesenchymal condensation, was significantly impaired. In situ hybridization analyses demonstrated that the expression of α1(II) collagen (Col2a1 — Mouse Genome Informatics), Sox5 and Sox6 in the prospective sternum of Prx1 DKO mice was severely attenuated, whereas Sox9 expression was unchanged. Molecular analyses revealed that Runx1 and Runx2 induce the expression of Sox5 and Sox6, which leads to the induction of α1(II) collagen expression via the direct regulation of promoter activity. Collectively, these results show that Runx1 and Runx2 cooperatively regulate sternal morphogenesis and the commitment of mesenchymal cells to become chondrocytes through the induction of Sox5 and Sox6.},

Here we have demonstrated that the antileukemic effect mediated by RUNX1 depletion is highly dependent on a functional p53-mediated cell death pathway. Increased expression of other RUNX family members, including RUNX2 and RUNX3, compensated for the antitumor effect elicited by RUNX1 silencing, and simultaneous attenuation of all RUNX family members as a cluster led to a much stronger antitumor effect relative to suppression of individual RUNX members. Switching off the RUNX cluster using alkylating agent–conjugated pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides, which were designed to specifically bind to consensus RUNX-binding sequences, was highly effective against AML cells and against several poor-prognosis solid tumors in a xenograft mouse model of AML without notable adverse events. Taken together, these results identify a crucial role for the RUNX cluster in the maintenance and progression of cancer cells and suggest that modulation of the RUNX cluster using the PI polyamide gene-switch technology is a potential strategy to control malignancies.},

One of the most common network motifs is the incoherent type-1 feed-forward loop (I1-FFL), in which a transcription activator activates a gene directly, and also activates a repressor of the gene. Mathematical modeling suggested that the I1-FFL can show two dynamical features: a transient pulse of gene expression, and acceleration of the dynamics of the target gene. It is important to experimentally study the dynamics of this motif in living cells, to test whether it carries out these functions even when embedded within additional interactions in the cell. Here, we address this using a system with incoherent feed-forward loop connectivity, the galactose (gal) system of Escherichia coli. We measured the dynamics of this system in response to inducing signals at high temporal resolution and accuracy by means of green fluorescent protein reporters. We show that the galactose system displays accelerated turn-on dynamics. The acceleration is abolished in strains and conditions that disrupt the I1-FFL. The I1-FFL motif in the gal system works as theoretically predicted despite being embedded in several additional feedback loops. Response acceleration may be performed by the incoherent feed-forward loop modules that are found in diverse systems from bacteria to humans.},

	abstract = {Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles: they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is the feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL, a three-gene pattern, is composed of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other, both jointly regulating a target gene. The FFL has eight possible structural types, because each of the three interactions in the FFL can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the FFL types, termed incoherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive accelerators: they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some FFL types appear in transcription network databases much more frequently than others. In some cases, the rare FFL types have reduced functionality (responding to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements in transcription networks.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic pathways can regulate gene expression by controlling and interpreting chromatin modifications. Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.},

Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.},

KMT4/Dot1 is a conserved histone methyltransferase capable of methylating chromatin on Lys79 of histone H3 (H3K79). Here we report the identification of a multisubunit Dot1 complex (DotCom), which includes several of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) partners in leukemia such as ENL, AF9/MLLT3, AF17/MLLT6, and AF10/MLLT10, as well as the known Wnt pathway modifiers TRRAP, Skp1, and beta-catenin. We demonstrated that the human DotCom is indeed capable of trimethylating H3K79 and, given the association of beta-catenin, Skp1, and TRRAP, we investigated, and found, a role for Dot1 in Wnt/Wingless signaling in an in vivo model system. Knockdown of Dot1 in Drosophila results in decreased expression of a subset of Wingless target genes. Furthermore, the loss of expression for the Drosophila homologs of the Dot1-associated proteins involved in the regulation of H3K79 shows a similar reduction in expression of these Wingless targets. From yeast to human, specific trimethylation of H3K79 by Dot1 requires the monoubiquitination of histone H2B by the Rad6/Bre1 complex. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Bre1, the E3 ligase required for H2B monoubiquitination, leads specifically to reduced bulk H3K79 trimethylation levels and a reduction in expression of many Wingless targets. Overall, our study describes for the first time the components of DotCom and links the specific regulation of H3K79 trimethylation by Dot1 and its associated factors to the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway.},

	abstract = {Yeast disruptor of telomeric silencing-1 (DOT1) is involved in gene silencing and in the pachytene checkpoint during meiotic cell cycle. Here we show that the Dot1 protein possesses intrinsic histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity. When compared with Rmt1, another putative yeast HMT, Dot1 shows very distinct substrate specificity. While Rmt1 methylates histone H4, Dot1 targets histone H3. In contrast to Rmt1, which can only modify free histones, Dot1 activity is specific to nucleosomal substrates. This was also confirmed using native chromatin purified from yeast cells. We also demonstrate that, like its mammalian homolog PRMT1, Rmt1 specifically dimethylates an arginine residue at position 3 of histone H4 N-terminal tail. In surprising contrast, methylation by Dot1 occurs in the globular domain of nucleosomal histone H3. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis suggests that H3 lysine 79 is trimethylated by Dot1. The intrinsic nucleosomal histone H3 methyltransferase activity of Dot1 is certainly a key aspect of its function in gene silencing at telomeres, most likely by directly modulating chromatin structure and Sir protein localization. In agreement with a role in regulating localization of histone deacetylase complexes like SIR, an increase of bulk histone acetylation is detected in dot1- cells.},

To identify additional therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells. We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as \textit{DOT1L}, \textit{BCL2}, and \textit{MEN1}, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose \textit{KAT2A} as a candidate for downstream study. \textit{KAT2A} inhibition demonstrated anti-AML activity by inducing myeloid differentiation and apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of primary human AMLs of diverse genotypes while sparing normal hemopoietic stem-progenitor cells. Our results propose that KAT2A inhibition should be investigated as a therapeutic strategy in AML and provide a large number of genetic vulnerabilities of this leukemia that can be pursued in downstream studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we employ synthetic gene circuits in Escherichia coli to measure the rise-times of non-self-regulated and of negatively autoregulated transcription units. Non-self-regulated units have a rise-time of one cell-cycle. We demonstrate experimentally that negative autoregulation feedback (also termed autogenous control) reduces the rise-time to about one fifth of a cell-cycle. This agrees with an analytical solution of a mathematical model for negative autoregulation. This may help in understanding the function of negative autoregulation, which appears in over 40\% of known transcription factors in E.coli.},

Gene disruption studies have revealed that Runx1/AML1 is required for definitive haematopoiesis but not for primitive haematopoiesis, but the precise stage of gene function is not yet known. We found that mice deficient in Runx1/AML1 (an alpha subunit of the transcription factor PEBP2/CBF) lack c-Kit+ haematopoietic cell clusters in the dorsal aorta, omphalomesenteric and umbilical arteries, as well as yolk sac vessels. Moreover, endothelial cells sorted from the embryo proper and the yolk sac of AML1-/- embryos are unable to differentiate into haematopoietic cells on OP9 stromal cells, whereas colonies of AML1-/- endothelial cells can be formed in culture. These results strongly suggest that the emergence of haematopoietic cells from endothelial cells represents a major pathway of definitive haematopoiesis and is an event that also occurs in the yolk sac in vivo, as suggested by earlier in vitro experiments.},

Their cooperative DNA binding with other transcription factors, such as AP1 proteins (FOS, JUN, and JUNB), FOXP3, IRFs, and EGR1, dictates the gene regulatory action of NFATs. To identify as yet unknown interaction partners of NFAT, we purified biotin-tagged NFATc1/αA, NFATc1/βC, and NFATc2/C protein complexes and analyzed their components by stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based mass spectrometry. We revealed more than 170 NFAT-associated proteins, half of which are involved in transcriptional regulation. Among them are many hitherto unknown interaction partners of NFATc1 and NFATc2 in T cells, such as Raptor, CHEK1, CREB1, RUNX1, SATB1, Ikaros, and Helios. The association of NFATc2 with several other transcription factors is DNA-dependent, indicating cooperative DNA binding. Moreover, our computational analysis discovered that binding motifs for RUNX and CREB1 are found preferentially in the direct vicinity of NFAT-binding motifs and in a distinct orientation to them. Furthermore, we provide evidence that mTOR and CHEK1 kinase activity influence NFAT's transcriptional potency. Finally, our dataset of NFAT-associated proteins provides a good basis to further study NFAT's diverse functions and how these are modulated due to the interplay of multiple interaction partners.},

Missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of GAT1 reduce its binding to the GATAA consensus sequence. However, we show experimentally, and using mathematical modeling, that decreases in GAT1 binding result in increased expression of MEP2 as a consequence of properties of I1-FFLs. Our results show that I1-FFLs, one of the most commonly occurring network motifs in transcriptional networks, can facilitate adaptive tuning of gene expression through modulation of transcription factor binding affinities.

It is therefore of interest to find molecular mechanisms of gene regulation that can provide such fold-change detection. Here we demonstrate theoretically that fold-change detection can be generated by one of the most common network motifs in transcription networks, the incoherent feedforward loop (I1-FFL), in which an activator regulates both a gene and a repressor of the gene.The fold-change detection feature of the I1-FFL applies to the entire shape of the response, including its amplitude and duration, and is valid for a wide range of biochemical parameters.},

Previous studies have revealed an increase in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells in conditional Runx1-knockout (KO) mice, but the molecular mechanism is unresolved. We investigated the myeloid progenitor (MP) compartment in KO mice, arguing that disruptions at the HSC/MPP level may be amplified in downstream cells. We demonstrate that the MP compartment is increased by more than fivefold in Runx1 KO mice, with a prominent skewing toward megakaryocyte (Meg) progenitors. Runx1-deficient granulocyte-macrophage progenitors are characterized by increased cloning capacity, impaired development into mature cells, and HSC and Meg transcription signatures. An HSC/MPP subpopulation expressing Meg markers was also increased in Runx1-deficient mice. Rescue experiments coupled with transcriptome analysis and Runx1 DNA-binding assays demonstrated that granulocytic/monocytic (G/M) commitment is marked by Runx1 suppression of genes encoding adherence and motility proteins (Tek, Jam3, Plxnc1, Pcdh7, and Selp) that support HSC–Meg interactions with the BM niche. In vitro assays confirmed that enforced Tek expression in HSCs/MPPs increases Meg output. Interestingly, besides this key repressor function of Runx1 to control lineage decisions and cell numbers in progenitors, our study also revealed a critical activating function in erythroblast differentiation, in addition to its known importance in Meg and G/M maturation. Thus both repressor and activator functions of Runx1 at multiple hematopoietic stages and lineages likely contribute to the tumor suppressor activity in MDS and AML.},

In prospective randomised trials, dexamethasone improved control of CNS leukaemia. At a prednisone-to-dexamethasone dose ratio of less than seven, dexamethasone (6-18 mg/m(2) per day) resulted in a better event-free survival than did prednisone (40-120 mg/m(2) per day), and high-dose dexamethasone (10-18 mg/m(2) per day) improved the outcome of T-cell ALL and high-risk ALL. However, dexamethasone caused more adverse effects, including infection, bone fracture, osteonecrosis, mood and behaviour problems, and myopathy. At a dose ratio greater than seven, the two drugs showed no difference in efficacy. Therefore, the efficacy of prednisone and dexamethasone is dose dependent and needs to be carefully assessed against the toxic effects. Moreover, although dexamethasone generally showed increased activity in ALL cells in vitro, the dose ratio of the two drugs that exerted equivalent cytotoxic effects differed substantially in samples from individuals. The selection of the type and dose of glucocorticoid should be based on the risk of relapse, treatment phase, and the chemotherapeutic drugs used concomitantly.},

Recently, the progression from E9.5 to E10.5 and polarity along the dorso-ventral axis have been identified as clear demarcations of the supportive HSC niche. To identify novel secreted regulators of HSC maturation, we performed RNA sequencing over these spatiotemporal transitions in the AGM region and supportive OP9 cell line. Screening several proteins through an ex vivo reaggregate culture system, we identify BMPER as a novel positive regulator of HSC development. We demonstrate that BMPER is associated with BMP signaling inhibition, but is transcriptionally induced by BMP4, suggesting that BMPER contributes to the precise control of BMP activity within the AGM region, enabling the maturation of HSCs within a BMP-negative environment. These findings and the availability of our transcriptional data through an accessible interface should provide insight into the maintenance and potential derivation of HSCs in culture.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Left-right asymmetry in vertebrates is initiated in an early embryonic structure called the ventral node in human and mouse, and the gastrocoel roof plate (GRP) in the frog. Within these structures, each epithelial cell bears a single motile cilium, and the concerted beating of these cilia produces a leftward fluid flow that is required to initiate left-right asymmetric gene expression. The leftward fluid flow is thought to result from the posterior tilt of the cilia, which protrude from near the posterior portion of each cell's apical surface. The cells, therefore, display a morphological planar polarization. Planar cell polarity (PCP) is manifested as the coordinated, polarized orientation of cells within epithelial sheets, or as directional cell migration and intercalation during convergent extension. A set of evolutionarily conserved proteins regulates PCP. Here, we provide evidence that vertebrate PCP proteins regulate planar polarity in the mouse ventral node and in the Xenopus gastrocoel roof plate. Asymmetric anterior localization of VANGL1 and PRICKLE2 (PK2) in mouse ventral node cells indicates that these cells are planar polarized by a conserved molecular mechanism. A weakly penetrant Vangl1 mutant phenotype suggests that compromised Vangl1 function may be associated with left-right laterality defects. Stronger functional evidence comes from the Xenopus GRP, where we show that perturbation of VANGL2 protein function disrupts the posterior localization of motile cilia that is required for leftward fluid flow, and causes aberrant expression of the left side-specific gene Nodal. The observation of anterior-posterior PCP in the mouse and in Xenopus embryonic organizers reflects a strong evolutionary conservation of this mechanism that is important for body plan determination.},

Presomitic mesenchymal cells, which normally contribute to both the epithelial and mesenchymal populations of the somite, were hyperepithelialized when Cdc42 signaling was blocked. Conversely, cells taking up genes that elevate Cdc42 levels remained mesenchymal. Thus, Cdc42 activity levels appear critical for the binary decision that defines the epithelial and mesenchymal somitic compartments. Proper levels of Rac1 are necessary for somitic epithelialization, since cells with activated or inhibited Rac1 failed to undergo correct epithelialization. Furthermore, Rac1 appears to be required for Paraxis to act as an epithelialization-promoting transcription factor during somitogenesis.},

All cell types polarize, at least transiently, during division or to generate specialized shapes and functions. This capacity extends from yeast to mammals, and it is now clear that many features of the molecular mechanisms controlling polarization are conserved in all eukaryotic cells. At the centre of the action is Cdc42, a small GTPase of the Rho family. Its activity is precisely controlled both temporally and spatially, and this can be achieved by a wide variety of extracellular cues in multicellular organisms. Moreover, although the functional characteristics of cell polarity are extremely variable (depending on the cell type and the biological context), Cdc42 has an amazing capacity to co-ordinate the control of multiple signal transduction pathways.},

Detailed cellular analysis demonstrated that Zeb2 is dispensable for hematopoietic cluster and HSC formation in the AGM region of the embryo but is essential for HSC/HPC differentiation. Additionally, Zeb2 deficient HSC/HPC fail to properly colonize the fetal liver and/or bone marrow and show enhanced adhesive properties associated with increased β1 integrin and Cxcr4 expression. Moreover, deletion of Zeb2 resulted in embryonic (Tie2-Cre) and perinatal (Vav-icre) lethality due to severe cephalic hemorrhaging accompanied with decreased levels of angiopoietin-1 and subsequently improper pericyte coverage of the cephalic vasculature. These results reveal essential roles for Zeb2 in embryonic hematopoiesis and are suggestive for a role for Zeb2 in hematopoietic related pathologies in the adult.},

The transition of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) from pluripotency to lineage commitment is not fully understood, and a role for phenotypic transcription factors in the initial stages of hESC differentiation remains to be explored. From a screen of candidate factors, we found that RUNX1 is selectively and transiently upregulated early in hESC differentiation to mesendodermal lineages. Transcriptome profiling and functional analyses upon RUNX1 depletion established a role for RUNX1 in promoting cell motility. In parallel, we discovered a loss of repression for several epithelial genes, indicating that loss of RUNX1 impaired an epithelial to mesenchymal transition during differentiation. Cell biological and biochemical approaches revealed that RUNX1 depletion specifically compromised TGFB2 signaling. Both the decrease in motility and deregulated epithelial marker expression upon RUNX1 depletion were rescued by reintroduction of TGFB2, but not TGFB1. These findings identify roles for RUNX1-TGFB2 signaling in early events of mesendodermal lineage commitment.},

	abstract = {The RUNX1 gene on human chromosome 21q22.12 belongs to the 'runt domain' gene family of transcription factors (also known as AML/CBFA/PEBP2alpha). RUNX1 is a key regulator of hematopoiesis and a frequent target of leukemia associated chromosomal translocations. Here we present a detailed analysis of the RUNX1 locus based on its complete genomic sequence. RUNX1 spans 260 kb and its expression is regulated through two distinct promoter regions, that are 160 kb apart. A very large CpG island complex marks the proximal promoter (promoter-2), and an additional CpG island is located at the 3' end of the gene. Hitherto, 12 different alternatively spliced RUNX1 cDNAs have been identified. Genomic sequence analysis of intron/exon boundaries of these cDNAs has shown that all consist of properly spliced authentic coding regions. This indicates that the large repertoire of RUNX1 proteins, ranging in size between 20-52 kDa, are generated through usage of alternatively spliced exons some of which contain in frame stop codons. The gene's introns are largely depleted of repetitive sequences, especially of the LINE1 family. The RUNX1 locus marks the transition from a {\textasciitilde}1 Mb of gene-poor region containing only pseudogenes, to a gene-rich region containing several functional genes. A search for RUNX1 sequences that may be involved in the high frequency of chromosomal translocations revealed that a 555 bp long segment originating in chromosome 11 FLI1 gene was transposed into RUNX1 intron 4.1. This intron harbors the t(8;21) and t(3;21) chromosomal breakpoints involved in acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, the FLI1 homologous sequence contains a breakpoint of the t(11;22) translocation associated with Ewing's tumors, and may have a similar function in RUNX1.},

However, very little is known about the biologic relevance of alternative Runx1 promoter usage in definitive hematopoietic cell emergence. Here we report that both promoters are active at the very onset of definitive hematopoiesis, with a skewing toward the P2. Moreover, functional and morphologic analysis of a novel P1-null and an attenuated P2 mouse model revealed that although both promoters play important nonredundant roles in the emergence of definitive hematopoietic cells, the proximal P2 was most critically required for this. The nature of the observed phenotypes is indicative of a differential contribution of the P1 and P2 promoters to the control of overall Runx1 levels, where and when this is most critically required. In addition, the dynamic expression of P1-Runx1 and P2-Runx1 points at a requirement for Runx1 early in development, when the P2 is still the prevalent promoter in the emerging hemogenic endothelium and/or first committed hematopoietic cells.},

	abstract = {The interest in stem cell based therapies has emphasized the importance of understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which stem cells are generated in ontogeny and maintained throughout adult life. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are first found in clusters of hematopoietic cells budding from the luminal wall of the major arteries in the developing mammalian embryo. The transcription factor Runx1 is critical for their generation and is specifically expressed at sites of HSC generation, prior to their formation. To understand better the transcriptional hierarchies that converge on Runx1 during HSC emergence, we have initiated studies into its transcriptional regulation. Here we systematically analyzed Runx1 P1 and P2 alternative promoter usage in hematopoietic sites and in sorted cell populations during mouse hematopoietic development. Our results indicate that Runx1 expression in primitive erythrocytes is largely P2-derived, whilst in definitive hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells from the yolk sac or AGM and vitelline and umbilical arteries both the distal P1 and proximal P2 promoters are active. After cells have migrated to the fetal liver, the P1 gradually becomes the main hematopoietic promoter and remains this into adulthood. In addition, we identified a novel P2-derived Runx1 isoform.},

We demonstrate that CRISPR-on can efficiently activate exogenous reporter genes in both human and mouse cells in a tunable manner. In addition, we show that robust reporter gene activation in vivo can be achieved by injecting the system components into mouse zygotes. Furthermore, we show that CRISPR-on can activate the endogenous IL1RN, SOX2, and OCT4 genes. The most efficient gene activation was achieved by clusters of 3-4 sgRNAs binding to the proximal promoters, suggesting their synergistic action in gene induction. Significantly, when sgRNAs targeting multiple genes were simultaneously introduced into cells, robust multiplexed endogenous gene activation was achieved.

Serving as a mammalian model system, the mouse has allowed for the discovery of self-renewing multipotent stem cells, provided functional assays to establish hematopoietic stem cell identity and function, and has become a tool for understanding the differentiation capacity of early hematopoietic progenitors. The advent of genetic technology has strengthened the use of mouse models for identifying critical pathways in hematopoiesis. Full genetic knockout models, tissue-specific gene deletion, and genetic overexpression models create a system for the dissection and identification of critical cellular and genetic processes underlying hematopoiesis. However, the murine model has also introduced perplexity in understanding developmental hematopoiesis. Requisite in utero development paired with circulation has historically made defining sites of origin and expansion in the murine hematopoietic system challenging. However, the genetic accessibility of the mouse as a mammalian system has identified key regulators of hematopoietic development. Technological advances continue to generate extremely powerful tools that when translated to the murine system provide refined in vivo spatial and temporal control of genetic deletion or overexpression. Future advancements may add the ability of reversible genetic manipulation. In this review, we describe the major contributions of the murine model to our understanding of hematopoiesis.},

For this reason, it has become the best understood stem cell-derived system that serves as a paradigm for stem cell biology and has found numerous applications in the clinics. While a lot of progress has recently been made in describing the bone marrow components that maintain and control blood stem cell function in the adult, very little is currently known about the regulatory microenvironment in which the first adult-repopulating hematopoietic stem cells are formed during development. Knowledge of these processes is crucial for understanding the basic regulation of hematopoietic stem cell production and behavior and to allow their in vitro expansion and generation from embryonic stem cells or iPS cells for clinical and research purposes. This review summarizes the recent advances that have been made in defining the cellular components, as well as the soluble and physical factors, that are part of the niche involved in regulating hematopoietic stem cell generation in the embryo. The findings are compared with what is known about the adult bone marrow niche to find common pathways for stem cell regulation, but also to highlight processes uniquely required for de novo hematopoietic stem cell generation, as these are the conditions that will need to be recreated for the successful production of blood stem cells in culture.},

We have generated a Runx1 +23 enhancer-reporter transgenic mouse (23GFP) for the prospective isolation of HE throughout embryonic development. Here we perform functional analysis of over 1,800 and transcriptional analysis of 268 single 23GFP(+) HE cells to explore the onset of EHT at the single-cell level. We show that initiation of the haematopoietic programme occurs in cells still embedded in the endothelial layer, and is accompanied by a previously unrecognized early loss of endothelial potential before HSCs emerge.

They emerge in the vertebrate conceptus around midgestation. Genetic studies have identified a number of transcription factors and signaling molecules that act at the onset of hematopoiesis, and have begun to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of HSCs. One molecule that has been a particularly useful marker of this developmental event in multiple species is Runx1 (also known as AML1, Pebp2alpha). Runx1 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, that along with its homologues Runx2 and Runx3 and their shared non-DNA binding subunit CBFbeta, constitute a small family of transcription factors called core-binding factors (CBFs). Runx1 is famous for its role in HSC emergence, and notorious for its involvement in leukemia, as chromosomal rearrangements and inactivating mutations in the human RUNX1 gene are some of the most common events in de novo and therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Here we will review the role of Runx1 in HSC emergence in the mouse conceptus and describe some of the genetic pathways that operate upstream and downstream of this gene. Where relevant, we will include data obtained from other species and embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation cultures.},

	abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

	abstract = {The evolutionarily conserved frizzled/starry night (fz/stan) pathway regulates planar cell polarity (PCP) in vertebrates and invertebrates. This pathway has been extensively studied in the Drosophila wing, where it is manifested by an array of distally pointing cuticular hairs. Using in vivo imaging we found that, early in hair growth, cells have multiple actin bundles and hairs that subsequently fuse into a single growing hair. The downstream PCP gene multiple wing hairs (mwh) plays a key role in this process and acts to antagonize the actin cytoskeleton. In mwh mutants hair initiation is not limited to a small region at the distal edge of pupal wing cells as in wild type, resulting in multiple hairs with aberrant polarity. Extra actin bundles/hairs are formed and do not completely fuse, in contrast to wild type. As development proceeded additional hairs continued to form, further increasing hair number. We identified a fragment of Mwh with in vivo rescue activity and that bound and bundled F-actin filaments and inhibited actin polymerization in in vitro actin assays. The loss of these activities can explain the mwh mutant phenotype. Our data suggest a model whereby, prior to hair initiation, proximally localized Mwh inhibits actin polymerization resulting in polarized activation of the cytoskeleton and hair formation on the distal side of wing cells. During hair growth Mwh is found in growing hairs, where we suggest it functions to promote the fusion of actin bundles and inhibit the formation of additional actin bundles that could lead to extra hairs.},

Here, using ex vivo modeling of HSC development, we identify precursors of definitive HSCs in the trunk of the embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) mouse embryo. These precursors, termed here pro-HSCs, are less mature than type I and II pre-HSCs. Although pro-HSCs are CD41(+), they lack the CD43 marker, which is gradually upregulated in the developing HSC lineage. We show that stem cell factor (SCF), but not interleukin-3 (IL-3), is a major effector of HSC maturation during E9-E10.

In this study, we developed a new coaggregation culture system, which supports maturation of a novel population of CD45-negative (VE-cad⁺CD45⁻CD41⁺) pre-HSCs into definitive HSCs. The appearance of these pre-HSCs precedes development of the VE-cad⁺CD45⁺ pre-HSCs (termed here type I and type II pre-HSCs, respectively), thus establishing a hierarchical directionality in the developing HSC lineage. By labeling the luminal surface of the dorsal aorta, we show that both type I and type II pre-HSCs are distributed broadly within the endothelial and subendothelial aortic layers, in contrast to mature definitive HSCs which localize to the aortic endothelial layer. In agreement with expression of CD41 in pre-HSCs, in vivo CD41-Cre-mediated genetic tagging occurs in embryonic pre-HSCs and persists in all lymphomyeloid lineages of the adult animal.},

Indeed, whether blood cells arise from mesodermal cells, mesenchymal progenitors, bipotent endothelial-haematopoietic precursors or haemogenic endothelial cells remains controversial. Proximity of endothelial and blood cells at sites of embryonic haematopoiesis, as well as their similar gene expression, led to the hypothesis of the endothelium generating blood. However, owing to lacking technology it has been impossible to observe blood cell emergence continuously at the single-cell level, and the postulated existence of haemogenic endothelial cells remains disputed. Here, using new imaging and cell-tracking methods, we show that embryonic endothelial cells can be haemogenic. By continuous long-term single-cell observation of mouse mesodermal cells generating endothelial cell and blood colonies, it was possible to detect haemogenic endothelial cells giving rise to blood cells. Living endothelial and haematopoietic cells were identified by simultaneous detection of morphology and multiple molecular and functional markers. Detachment of nascent blood cells from endothelium is not directly linked to asymmetric cell division, and haemogenic endothelial cells are specified from cells already expressing endothelial markers. These results improve our understanding of the developmental origin of mammalian blood and the potential generation of haematopoietic stem cells from embryonic stem cells.},

By time-lapse microscopy of Runx1-enhanced green fluorescent protein transgenic zebrafish embryos, we were able to capture a subset of cells within the ventral endothelium of the dorsal aorta, as they acquire hemogenic properties and directly emerge as presumptive HSCs. These nascent hematopoietic cells assume a rounded morphology, transiently occupy the subaortic space, and eventually enter the circulation via the caudal vein. Cell tracing showed that these cells subsequently populated the sites of definitive hematopoiesis (thymus and kidney), consistent with an HSC identity. HSC numbers depended on activity of the transcription factor Runx1, on blood flow, and on proper development of the dorsal aorta (features in common with mammals).

Overviews and selected features of the patterns are presented and the full 3D data set, generated by fully described probes, is available to the research community through the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas of Gene Expression. In addition to being comprehensive, the data set has been generated and recorded in a consistent manner to facilitate comparisons between gene expression patterns with the capacity to generate matching virtual sections from the 3D representations for specific studies. Expression patterns in the left forelimb were selected for more detailed comparative description. In addition to confirming the previously published expression of these genes, our whole embryo and limb bud analyses significantly extend the data in terms of details of the patterns and the addition of previously undetected sites of expression. Our focussed analysis of expression domains in the limb, defined by just two gene families, reveals a surprisingly high degree of spatial complexity and underlines the enormous potential for local cellular interactions that exist within an emerging structure. This work also highlights the use of OPT to generate detailed high-quality, spatially complex expression data that is readily comparable between specimens and can be reviewed and reanalysed as required for specific studies. It represents a core set of data that will be extended with additional stages of development and through addition of potentially interacting genes and ultimately other cross-regulatory communication pathways operating in the embryo.},

In the utricle and saccule the hair cells are arranged in an orderly array about an abrupt line of reversal that separates fields of cells with opposite polarity. We report that the putative PCP protein Prickle-like 2 (Pk2) is distributed in crescents on the medial sides of vestibular epithelial cells before the morphological polarization of hair cells. Despite the presence of a line of polarity reversal, crescent position is not altered between hair cells of opposite polarity. Frizzled 6 (Fz6), a second PCP protein, is distributed opposite Pk2 along the lateral side of vestibular support cells. Similar to Pk2, the subcellular localization of Fz6 does not differ between cells located on opposite sides of the line of reversal. In addition, in Looptail/Van Gogh-like2 mutant mice Pk2 is distributed asymmetrically at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), but this localization is not coordinated between adjacent cells, and the crescents subsequently are lost by E18.5. Together, these results support the idea that a conserved PCP complex acts before stereocilia bundle development to provide an underlying polarity to all cells in the vestibular epithelia and that cells on either side of the line of reversal are programmed to direct the kinocilium in opposite directions with respect to the polarity axis defined by PCP protein distribution.},

Angiogenesis also involves the growth and migration of polarized cells, although the mechanisms underlying their intercellular communication are poorly understood.

Silencing of either Dvl2 or Prickle suppressed endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, loss of p53 rescues endothelial cell growth arrest but not the migration inhibition caused by PCP disruption. In addition, we show that the zebrafish Wnt5 mutant (pipetail (ppt)), which has impaired PCP signaling, displays vascular developmental defects. These findings reveal a potential role for PCP signaling in the coordinated assembly of endothelial cells into vascular structures and have important implications for vascular remodeling in development and disease.},

	abstract = {The coordinated polarization of neighboring cells within the plane of the tissue, known as planar cell polarity (PCP), is a recurring theme in biology. It is required for numerous developmental processes for the form and function of many tissues and organs across species. The genetic pathway regulating PCP was first discovered in Drosophila, and an analogous but distinct pathway is emerging in vertebrates. It consists of membrane protein complexes known as core PCP proteins that are conserved across species. Here we report that the over-expression of the murine Ankrd6 (mAnkrd6) gene that shares homology with Drosophila core PCP gene diego causes a typical PCP phenotype in Drosophila, and mAnkrd6 can rescue the loss of function of diego in Drosophila. In mice, mAnkrd6 protein is asymmetrically localized in cells of the inner ear sensory organs, characteristic of components of conserved core PCP complexes. The loss of mAnkrd6 causes PCP defects in the inner ear sensory organs. Moreover, canonical Wnt signaling is significantly increased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from mAnkrd6 knockout mice in comparison to wild type controls. Together, these results indicated that mAnkrd6 is a functional homolog of the Drosophila diego gene for mammalian PCP regulation and act to suppress canonical Wnt signaling.},

In this report, we demonstrate that actomyosin contractility and planar cell polarity (PCP) interact in post-mitotic Ciona notochord cells to self-assemble and reposition actomyosin rings, which play an essential role for cell elongation. Intriguingly, rings always form at the cells' anterior edge before migrating towards the center as contractility increases, reflecting a novel dynamical property of the cortex. Our drug and genetic manipulations uncover a tug-of-war between contractility, which localizes cortical flows toward the equator and PCP, which tries to reposition them. We develop a simple model of the physical forces underlying this tug-of-war, which quantitatively reproduces our results. We thus propose a quantitative framework for dissecting the relative contribution of contractility and PCP to the self-assembly and repositioning of cytoskeletal structures, which should be applicable to other morphogenetic events.},

Prickle localizes to the proximal side of pupal wing cells and binds the Dishevelled DEP domain, inhibiting Dishevelled membrane localization and antagonizing Frizzled accumulation.

We showed previously that PTK7, a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in planar cell polarity, plays a role in epithelial Wnt signaling; however, its function in hematopoiesis has remained unexplored. In this article, we show that PTK7 is expressed by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, with the highest level of protein expression found on HSCs. Taking advantage of a Ptk7-deficient mouse strain, we demonstrate that loss of Ptk7 leads to a diminished pool of HSCs but does not affect in vitro or in vivo hematopoietic cell differentiation.

Both hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC)–enriched embryonic avian bone marrow cells and the quail mesodermal stem cell line QCE6 were used for these studies. Under optimized conditions, the bone marrow and QCE6 cells behaved identically and developed into red blood cells (RBCs), monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and thrombocytes. This broad range of blood cell phenotypes exhibited by QCE6 cells was dependent on their active expression of WNT11. However, when QCE6 cells were prevented from producing WNT11—by expression of a stably transfected WNT11 antisense transgene—the cultures were dominated by highly vacuolated macrophages. RBCs were absent from these cultures, and the presence of monocytes was greatly diminished. Exposure of these WNT11 antisense cells to soluble WNT11 or WNT5a restored the broad range of blood cell phenotypes exhibited by parental QCE6 cells. Overexpression of WNT protein in QCE6 cells further increased the prevalence of RBCs and monocytes and greatly diminished the appearance of macrophages. Accordingly, treatment of HPC-enriched bone marrow cultures with soluble WNT11 or WNT5a inhibited macrophage formation. Instead, monocytes and RBCs were the prevalent cells displayed by WNT-treated bone marrow cultures. Together, these data indicate that WNTs may play a major role in regulating hematopoietic cell fate.},

	abstract = {Background
While the role of canonical (β-catenin-mediated) Wnt signaling in hematolymphopoiesis has been studied extensively, little is known of the potential importance of non-canonical Wnt signals in hematopoietic cells. Wnt4 is one of the Wnt proteins that can elicit non-canonical pathways. We have previously shown that retroviral overexpression of Wnt4 by hematopoietic cells increased thymic cellularity as well as the frequency of early thymic progenitors and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). However, the molecular pathways responsible for its effect in HPCs are not known.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Here we report that Wnt4 stimulation resulted in the activation of the small GTPase Rac1 as well as Jnk kinases in an HPC cell line. Jnk activity was necessary, while β-catenin was dispensable, for the Wnt4-mediated expansion of primary fetal liver HPCs in culture. Furthermore, Jnk2-deficient and Wnt4 hemizygous mice presented lower numbers of HPCs in their bone marrow, and Jnk2-deficient HPCs showed increased rates of apoptosis. Wnt4 also improved HPC activity in a competitive reconstitution model in a cell-autonomous, Jnk2-dependent manner. Lastly, we identified Fz6 as a receptor for Wnt4 in immature HPCs and showed that the absence of Wnt4 led to a decreased expression of four polarity complex genes.

Conclusions/Significance
Our results establish a functional role for non-canonical Wnt signaling in hematopoiesis through a pathway involving Wnt4, Fz6, Rac1 and Jnk kinases.},

Bone marrow and peripheral blood from 16 donors were evaluated and our results were compared with the GeneNote database expression arrays. In bone marrow, only WNT3, WNT10A, FZD3, FZD7 and sFRP1 genes are constitutively expressed. Lymphocytes express WNT7A, WNT9B, FZD6 and FZD7 in addition to the genes above, but T cells differ in that they lose sFRP1 expression and gain constitutive expression of WNT16.

	abstract = {Quantitative analysis of the vascular network anatomy is critical for the understanding of the vasculature structure and function. In this study, we have combined microcomputed tomography (microCT) and computational analysis to provide quantitative three-dimensional geometrical and topological characterization of the normal kidney vasculature, and to investigate how 2 core genes of the Wnt/planar cell polarity, Frizzled4 and Frizzled6, affect vascular network morphogenesis. Experiments were performed on frizzled4 (Fzd4-/-) and frizzled6 (Fzd6-/-) deleted mice and littermate controls (WT) perfused with a contrast medium after euthanasia and exsanguination. The kidneys were scanned with a high-resolution (16 μm) microCT imaging system, followed by 3D reconstruction of the arterial vasculature. Computational treatment includes decomposition of 3D networks based on Diameter-Defined Strahler Order (DDSO). We have calculated quantitative (i) Global scale parameters, such as the volume of the vasculature and its fractal dimension (ii) Structural parameters depending on the DDSO hierarchical levels such as hierarchical ordering, diameter, length and branching angles of the vessel segments, and (iii) Functional parameters such as estimated resistance to blood flow alongside the vascular tree and average density of terminal arterioles. In normal kidneys, fractal dimension was 2.07±0.11 (n = 7), and was significantly lower in Fzd4-/- (1.71±0.04; n = 4), and Fzd6-/- (1.54±0.09; n = 3) kidneys. The DDSO number was 5 in WT and Fzd4-/-, and only 4 in Fzd6-/-. Scaling characteristics such as diameter and length of vessel segments were altered in mutants, whereas bifurcation angles were not different from WT. Fzd4 and Fzd6 deletion increased vessel resistance, calculated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, for each DDSO, and decreased the density and the homogeneity of the distal vessel segments. Our results show that our methodology is suitable for 3D quantitative characterization of vascular networks, and that Fzd4 and Fzd6 genes have a deep patterning effect on arterial vessel morphogenesis that may determine its functional efficiency.},

ERG mRNA overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in a subset of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, a genome-wide screen of ERG target genes was conducted by chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-chip) in Jurkat cells. In this screen, 342 significant annotated genes were derived from this global approach. Notably, ERG-enriched targets included WNT signaling genes: WNT11, WNT2, WNT9A, CCND1 and FZD7. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of normal and primary leukemia bone marrow material also confirmed WNT11 as a target of ERG in six of seven patient samples. A larger sampling of patient diagnostic material revealed that ERG and WNT11 mRNA were co-expressed in 80\% of AML (n=30) and 40\% in T-ALL (n=30) bone marrow samples. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of ERG confirmed downregulation of WNT11 transcripts. Conversely, in a tet-on ERG-inducible assay, WNT11 transcripts were co-stimulated. A WNT pathway agonist, 6-bromoindirubin-3-oxime (BIO), was used to determine the effect of cell growth on the ERG-inducible cells. The addition of BIO resulted in an ERG-dependent proliferative growth advantage over ERG-uninduced cells. Finally, ERG induction prompted morphological transformation whereby round unpolarized K562 cells developed elongated protrusions and became polarized. This morphological transformation could effectively be inhibited with BIO and with siRNA knockdown of WNT11. In conclusion, ERG transcriptional networks in leukemia converge on WNT signaling targets. Specifically, WNT11 emerged as a direct target of ERG. Potent ERG induction promoted morphological transformation through WNT11 signals. The findings in this study unravel new ERG-directed molecular signals that may contribute to the resistance of current therapies in acute leukemia patients with poor prognosis characterized by high ERG mRNA expression.},

The core pathway functions via a mechanism involving segregation of its protein components to opposite cells ends, where they form asymmetric intracellular complexes that couple cell-cell polarity. This segregation is a self-organizing process driven by feedback interactions between the core proteins themselves. Despite intense efforts, the molecular pathways underlying feedback have proven difficult to elucidate using conventional genetic approaches. Here we investigate core protein function during planar polarization of the Drosophila wing by combining quantitative measurements of protein dynamics with loss-of-function genetics, mosaic analysis, and temporal control of gene expression. Focusing on the key core protein Frizzled, we show that its stable junctional localization is promoted by the core proteins Strabismus, Dishevelled, Prickle, and Diego. In particular, we show that the stabilizing function of Prickle on Frizzled requires Prickle activity in neighboring cells. Conversely, Prickle in the same cell has a destabilizing effect on Frizzled. This destabilizing activity is dependent on the presence of Dishevelled and blocked in the absence of Dynamin and Rab5 activity, suggesting an endocytic mechanism. Overall, our approach reveals for the first time essential in vivo stabilizing and destabilizing interactions of the core proteins required for self-organization of planar polarity.,

However, the mechanism of TE formation is currently not well understood. Prickle1 (Pk1), a core component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, is essential for epiblast polarization before gastrulation, yet the roles of Pk family members in early mouse embryogenesis are obscure. Here we found that Pk2−/− embryos died at E3.0–3.5 without forming the blastocyst cavity and not maintained epithelial integrity of TE. These phenotypes were due to loss of the apical-basal (AB) polarity that underlies the asymmetric redistribution of microtubule networks and proper accumulation of AB polarity components on each membrane during compaction. In addition, we found GTP-bound active form of nuclear RhoA was decreased in Pk2−/− embryos during compaction. We further show that the first cell fate decision was disrupted in Pk2−/− embryos. Interestingly, Pk2 localized to the nucleus from the 2-cell to around the 16-cell stage despite its cytoplasmic function previously reported. Inhibiting farnesylation blocked Pk2’s nuclear localization and disrupted AB cell polarity, suggesting that Pk2 farnesylation is essential for its nuclear localization and function. The cell polarity phenotype was efficiently rescued by nuclear but not cytoplasmic Pk2, demonstrating the nuclear localization of Pk2 is critical for its function.},

During vertebrate gastrulation, mesodermal and ectodermal cells undergo convergent extension, a process characterised by prominent cellular rearrangements in which polarised cells intercalate along the medio-lateral axis leading to elongation of the antero-posterior axis. Recently, it has become evident that a noncanonical Wnt/Frizzled (Fz)/Dishevelled (Dsh) signalling pathway, which is related to the planar-cell-polarity (PCP) pathway in flies, regulates convergent extension during vertebrate gastrulation. Here we isolate and functionally characterise a zebrafish homologue of Drosophila prickle (pk), a gene that is implicated in the regulation of PCP. Zebrafish pk1 is expressed maternally and in moving mesodermal precursors. Abrogation of Pk1 function by morpholino oligonucleotides leads to defective convergent extension movements, enhances the silberblick (slb)/wnt11 and pipetail (Ppt)/wnt5 phenotypes and suppresses the ability of Wnt11 to rescue the slb phenotype. Gain-of-function of Pk1 also inhibits convergent extension movements and enhances the slb phenotype, most likely caused by the ability of Pk1 to block the Fz7-dependent membrane localisation of Dsh by downregulating levels of Dsh protein. Furthermore, we show that pk1 interacts genetically with trilobite (tri)/strabismus to mediate the caudally directed migration of cranial motor neurons and convergent extension. These results indicate that, during zebrafish gastrulation Pk1 acts, in part, through interaction with the noncanonical Wnt11/Wnt5 pathway to regulate convergent extension cell movements, but is unlikely to simply be a linear component of this pathway. In addition, Pk1 interacts with Tri to mediate posterior migration of branchiomotor neurons, probably independent of the noncanonical Wnt pathway.},

To examine Prickle1 function along a broader developmental window, we generated three mutant alleles in mice. We show that the complete loss of Prickle1 leads to systemic tissue outgrowth defects, aberrant cell organization and disruption of polarity machinery. Curiously, Prickle1 mutants recapitulate the characteristic features of human Robinow syndrome and phenocopy mouse mutants with Wnt5a or Ror2 gene defects, prompting us to explore an association of Prickle1 with the Wnt pathway. We show that Prickle1 is a proteasomal target of Wnt5a signaling and that Dvl2, a target of Wnt5a signaling, is misregulated in Prickle1 mutants. Our studies implicate Prickle1 as a key component of the Wnt-signaling pathway and suggest that Prickle1 mediates some of the WNT5A-associated genetic defects in Robinow syndrome.},

We found that the deletion of mpk1 gene resulted in early embryonic lethality, between embryonic day (E)5.5 and E6.5, associated with failure of distal visceral endoderm migration and primitive streak formation. The mpk1−/− epiblast tissue was disorganized, and analyses at the cellular level revealed abnormal cell shapes, mislocalized extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and disrupted orientation of mitotic spindles, from which loss of apico-basal (AB) polarity of epiblast cells are suspected. Furthermore, we show mpk1 genetically interacts with another core PCP gene Vangl2/stbm in the epiblast formation, suggesting that PCP components are commonly required for the establishment and/or the maintenance of epiblast AB polarity. This was further supported by our finding that overexpression of ΔPET/LIM (ΔP/L), a dominant-negative Pk construct, in Xenopus embryo disrupted uniform localization of an apical marker PKCζ, and expanded the apical domain of ectoderm cells.

	abstract = {Background
Wnt/PCP signaling plays a critical role in multiple developmental processes, including limb development. Wnt5a, a ligand of the PCP pathway, signals through the Ror2/Vangl2 or the Vangl2/Ryk complex to regulate limb development along the proximal-distal axis in mice. Based on the interaction between Van Gogh and Prickle in Drosophila, we hypothesized the vertebrate Prickle1 have similar function as Vangl2 in limb development.

Results
We show Prickle1 is expressed in the skeletal condensates that will differentiate into chondrocytes and later form bones. Disrupted Prickle1 function in Prickle1C251X/C251X mouse mutants alters expression of genes such as Bmp4, Fgf8, Vangl2 and Wnt5a. These expression changes correlate with shorter and wider bones in the limbs and loss of one phalangeal segment in digits 2-5 of Prickle1C251X mutants. These growth defects along the proximal-distal axis are also associated with increased cell death in the growing digit tip, reduced cell death in the interdigital membrane and disrupted chondrocyte polarity.

Conclusions
We suggest Prickle1 is part of the Wnt5a/PCP signaling, regulating cell polarity and affecting expression of multiple factors to stunt limb growth through altered patterns of gene expression, including the PCP genes Wnt5a and Vangl2.},

Here we describe the anteroposterior planar cell polarity (AP-PCP) of the cells in the Xenopus neural plate. At the neural midline, the Vangl2 protein is enriched at anterior cell edges and that this localization is directed by Prickle, a Vangl2-interacting protein. Our further analysis is consistent with the model, in which Vangl2 AP-PCP is established in the neural plate as a consequence of Wnt-dependent phosphorylation. Additionally, we uncover feedback regulation of Vangl2 polarity by Myosin II, reiterating a role for mechanical forces in PCP. These observations indicate that both Wnt signaling and Myosin II activity regulate cell polarity and cell behaviors during vertebrate neurulation.},

	abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a ubiquitous property of animal tissues and is essential for morphogenesis and homeostasis. In most cases, this fundamental property is governed by a deeply conserved set of ‘core PCP’ proteins, which includes the transmembrane proteins Van Gogh-like (Vangl) and Frizzled (Fzd), as well as the cytoplasmic effectors Prickle (Pk) and Dishevelled (Dvl). Asymmetric localization of these proteins is thought to be central to their function, and understanding the dynamics of these proteins is an important challenge in developmental biology. Among the processes that are organized by the core PCP proteins is the directional beating of cilia, such as those in the vertebrate node, airway and brain. Here, we exploit the live imaging capabilities of Xenopus to chart the progressive asymmetric localization of fluorescent reporters of Dvl1, Pk2 and Vangl1 in a planar polarized ciliated epithelium. Using this system, we also characterize the influence of Pk2 on the asymmetric dynamics of Vangl1 at the cell cortex, and we define regions of Pk2 that control its own localization and those impacting Vangl1. Finally, our data reveal a striking uncoupling of Vangl1 and Dvl1 asymmetry. This study advances our understanding of conserved PCP protein functions and also establishes a rapid, tractable platform to facilitate future in vivo studies of vertebrate PCP protein dynamics., Summary: Live imaging in Xenopus reveals that Pk2, a cytoplasmic effector of the PCP pathway, controls the directional ciliary beating in multiciliated cells by regulating Vangl1 dynamics at the cell cortex.},

One type of ciliopathy, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, is a rare disorder characterized by obesity, retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, mental retardation and susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. The Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) has been associated with cilia function and ciliogenesis in directing the orientation of cilia and basal bodies. Yet the exact relationship between PCP and ciliopathy is not well understood. Here, we examine interactions between a core PCP component, Prickle2 (Pk2), and a central BBS gene, Bbs7, using gene knockdown in the zebrafish. pk2 and bbs7 knockdown both disrupt the formation of a ciliated organ, the Kupffer’s Vesicle (KV), but do not display a synergistic interaction. By measuring cell polarity in the neural tube, we find that bbs7 activity is not required for Pk asymmetric localization. Moreover, BBS protein complex formation is preserved in the Pk2-deficient (Pk2−/−) mouse. Previously we reported an intracellular melanosome transport delay as a cardinal feature of reduced bbs gene activity. We find that pk2 knockdown suppresses bbs7-related retrograde transport delay. Similarly, knockdown of ift22, an anterograde intraflagellar transport component, also suppresses the bbs7-related retrograde delay. Notably, we find that pk2 knockdown larvae show a delay in anterograde transport. These data suggest a novel role for Pk2 in directional intracellular transport and our analyses show that PCP and BBS function independently, yet result in overlapping phenotypes when knocked down in zebrafish.},

By contrast, defects in autophagy lead to cell death, chronic inflammation, and genetic instability. Thus, stimulating autophagy may be a powerful approach for chemoprevention. Analogous to infection or toxins that create persistent tissue damage and chronic inflammation that increases the incidence of cancer, defective autophagy represents a cell-intrinsic mechanism to create the damaging, inflammatory environment that predisposes to cancer. Thus, cellular damage mitigation through autophagy is a novel mechanism of tumor suppression.},

	abstract = {Recently, we proposed a new paradigm for understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer onset and progression. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent fibroblasts. This, in turn, results in the onset of stromal autophagy, which produces recycled nutrients to “feed” anabolic cancer cells. However, it remains unknown how autophagy in the tumor microenvironment relates to inflammation, another key driver of tumorigenesis. To address this issue, here we employed a well-characterized co-culture system in which cancer cells induce autophagy in adjacent fibroblasts via oxidative stress and NFκB-activation. We show, using this co-culture system, that the same experimental conditions that result in an autophagic microenvironment, also drive in the production of numerous inflammatory mediators (including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MIP1a, IFNg, RANTES (CCL5) and GMCSF). Furthermore, we demonstrate that most of these inflammatory mediators are individually sufficient to directly induce the onset of autophagy in fibroblasts. To further validate the in vivo relevance of these findings, we assessed the inflammatory status of Cav-1 (-/-) null mammary fat pads, which are a model of a bonafide autophagic microenvironment. Notably, we show that Cav-1 (-/-) mammary fat pads undergo infiltration with numerous inflammatory cell types, including lymphocytes, T-cells, macrophages and mast cells. Taken together, our results suggest that cytokine production and inflammation are key drivers of autophagy in the tumor microenvironment. These results may explain why a loss of stromal Cav-1 is a powerful predictor of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, as it is a marker of both (1) autophagy and (2) inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Lastly, hypoxia in fibroblasts was not sufficient to induce the full-blown inflammatory response that we observed during the co-culture of fibroblasts with cancer cells, indicating that key reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts may be required.},

Treating cultured C2C12 myotubes with oxidant hydrogen peroxide (4 h) resulted in increased p38 phosphorylation and reduced FoxO3 phosphorylation along with induced Atg7 mRNA expression without activation of NF-κB or FoxO3a transcriptional activities. Furthermore, inhibition of p38α/β by SB202190 blocked hydrogen peroxide-induced atrophy with diminished upregulation of Atg7 and atrogenes [muscle atrophy F-box protein (MAFbx/Atrogin-1), muscle ring finger protein 1 (MuRF-1), and Nedd4]. These findings provide direct evidence for p38α/β MAPK in mediating oxidative stress-induced autophagy-related genes, suggesting that p38α/β MAPK regulates both the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome systems in muscle wasting.},

To clarify this issue we have generated conditional and inducible knockout mice for the critical gene Atg7, to block autophagy specifically in skeletal muscle. Atg7 null muscles reveal an unexpected phenotype which is characterized by muscle atrophy, weakness and features of myofiber degeneration. Morphological, biochemical, and molecular analyses of our autophagy knockout mice show the presence of protein aggregates, abnormal mitochondria, accumulation of membrane bodies, sarcoplasmic reticulum distension, vacuolization, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Moreover, autophagy inhibition does not protect skeletal muscles from atrophy during denervation and fasting, but instead promotes greater muscle loss. In conclusion, autophagy plays a critical role for myofiber maintenance and its activation is crucial to avoid accumulation of toxic proteins and dysfunctional organelles that, in the end, would lead to atrophy and weakness.},

Weakness in these patients can manifest as either severe limb muscle weakness (even to the point of virtual paralysis), respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilatory support, and/or some combination of these phenomena. While factors such as nutritional deficiency and disuse may contribute to the development of muscle weakness in these conditions, systemic inflammation may be the major factor producing skeletal muscle dysfunction in these disorders. Importantly, studies conducted over the past 15 years indicate that free radical species (superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and the free radical-derived product hydrogen peroxide) play an key role in modulating inflammation and/or infection-induced alterations in skeletal muscle function. Substantial evidence exists indicating that several free radical species can directly alter contractile protein function, and evidence suggests that free radicals also have important effects on sarcoplasmic reticulum function, on mitochondrial function, and on sarcolemmal integrity. Free radicals also modulate activation of several proteolytic pathways, including proteosomally mediated protein degradation and, at least theoretically, may also influence pathways of protein synthesis. As a result, free radicals appear to play an important role in regulating a number of downstream processes that collectively act to impair muscle function and lead to reductions in muscle strength and mass in inflammatory conditions.},

	abstract = {The ability of Cannabis sativa (marijuana) to increase hunger has been noticed for centuries, although intensive research on its molecular mode of action started only after the characterization of its main psychoactive component 9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the late 1960s. Despite the public concern related to the abuse of marijuana and its derivatives, scientific studies have pointed to the therapeutic potentials of cannabinoid compounds and have highlighted their ability to stimulate appetite, especially for sweet and palatable food. Later, the discovery of specific receptors and their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) suggested the existence of an endogenous cannabinoid system, providing a physiological basis for biological effects induced by marijuana and other cannabinoids. Epidemiological reports describing the appetite-stimulating properties of cannabinoids and the recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cannabinoid action have proposed a central role of the cannabinoid system in obesity. The aim of this review is to provide an extensive overview on the role of this neuromodulatory system in feeding behavior by summarizing the most relevant data obtained from human and animal studies and by elucidating the interactions of the cannabinoid system with the most important neuronal networks and metabolic pathways involved in the control of food intake. Finally, a critical evaluation of future potential therapeutical applications of cannabinoid antagonists in the therapy of obesity and eating disorders will be discussed.},

Autophagy has multiple physiological functions in multicellular organisms, including protein degradation and organelle turnover. Genes and proteins that constitute the basic machinery of the autophagic process were first identified in the yeast system and some of their mammalian orthologues have been characterized as well. Increasing lines of evidence indicate that these molecular mechanisms may be recruited by an alternative, caspase-independent form of programmed cell death, named autophagic type II cell death. In some settings, autophagy and apoptosis seem to be interconnected positively or negatively, introducing the concept of 'molecular switches' between them. Additionally, mitochondria may be central organelles integrating the two types of cell death. Malignant transformation is frequently associated with suppression of autophagy. The recent implication of tumor suppressors like Beclin 1, DAP-kinase and PTEN in autophagic pathways indicates a causative role for autophagy deficiencies in cancer formation. Autophagic cell death induction by some anticancer agents underlines the potential utility of its induction as a new cancer treatment modality.},

	abstract = {Oxygen consumption (QO2) and net K+ transport were studied in rabbit proximal tubule suspensions to define the early effects of cisplatin on proximal tubule function. Cisplatin caused dose-dependent inhibition of QO2, which was delayed in onset. The concentration of cisplatin required for inhibition decreased as the duration of exposure was increased [40-min exposure, threshold concentration of 10(-4) M, inhibitor constant (Ki) of 10(-3) M; 4-h exposure, threshold concentration of 3 X 10(-5) M, Ki of 10(-4) M]. Both ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-insensitive QO2 were reduced, indicating inhibition of all adenosinetriphosphatases, including Na(+)- K(+)-ATPase activity. There was a parallel fall in ouabain-sensitive net K+ transport and cytosolic K+ content, confirming the latter observation. Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was unchanged in cell membranes prepared by hypotonic lysis from cisplatin-treated tubules, indicating an indirect cytosol-dependent mechanism of enzyme inhibition. Nystatin-stimulated QO2 was reduced in cisplatin-treated tubules, excluding inhibition of Na+ entry as the mechanism of injury and suggesting mitochondrial injury. The latter was confirmed by measurement of carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP)-uncoupled QO2 in intact cells and ADP-stimulated (state 3) QO2 in digitonin-permeabilized tubules. Furthermore, by maximally stimulating mitochondrial respiration with CCCP and nystatin, it was possible to demonstrate mitochondrial injury at a time when basal QO2 and K+ transport were apparently normal. These data suggest that mitochondrial injury is a central event in cisplatin toxicity to the proximal tubule.},

Some literature in the last decade has suggested a possible direct effect of cisplatin on mitochondria independent of nDNA interaction. In this study, we define separately the sequelae of cisplatin interactions with nDNA and with mitochondria in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines.
Experimental Design: Cisplatin binding to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and proteins was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy and other methods.
Results: Following 1 hour of exposure to cisplatin, platinum adducts to mtDNA were 300- to 500-fold more abundant than adducts to nDNA; these differences were not due to differences in rates of adduct repair. Whereas HNSCC cell cytoplasts free of nDNA retained the same dose-dependent cisplatin sensitivity as parental cells, HNSCC ρ0 cells free of mtDNA were 4- to 5-fold more resistant to cisplatin than parental cells. Isolated mitochondria released cytochrome c within minutes of exposure to cisplatin, and ultrastructural analysis of intact HNSCC cells by electron microscopy showed marked mitochondrial disruption after 4 hours of cisplatin treatment, whereas the nucleus and other cellular structures remain intact. The very prompt release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria implies that apoptosis does not require alteration in mitochondrial gene transcription. Further, cisplatin binds preferentially to mitochondrial membrane proteins, particularly the voltage-dependent anion channel.
Conclusions: Cisplatin binding to nDNA is not necessary for induction of apoptosis in HNSCC, which can result from direct action of cisplatin on mitochondria.},

CB1R and CB2R activities influence signal cascades, which are known to play a role in the regulation of the cellular “self-digestion” process called autophagy. A variety of these signaling pathways are integrated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) that acts as an inhibitor of autophagy. Others, like AMP-activated protein kinase dependent signaling pathway, are able to bypass mTORC1 to modulate the autophagic activity directly. In the recent years, several scientific reports demonstrate an involvement of CB1R and CB2R signaling in the control of the autophagic activity in different paradigms. In this review, we summarize the recent literature on this topic, which is in part contradictory and therefore, it is of great importance to illuminate the results of the single reports in the physiological context of the model systems used in these studies.

The impaired clearance of damaged macromolecules due to the low cathepsin D levels and not enhanced oxidative stress may be responsible for the lipofuscin accumulation because macromolecule oxidation levels were comparable between the genotypes within the same age group. The altered levels of autophagy markers p62 and LC3-II suggest that autophagy is upregulated in CB1 knockout mice. Increased autophagic flux in the absence of CB1 receptors is probably a compensatory mechanism to partially counteract decreased lysosomal degradation capacity.

Cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor is involved in whole-body and cellular energy metabolism. We asked whether CB1 receptor stimulation was able to decrease mitochondrial biogenesis in different metabolically active tissues of obese high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The effects of selective CB1 agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethanolamide (ACEA) and endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression were examined, as were mitochondrial DNA amount and mitochondrial biogenesis parameters in cultured mouse and human white adipocytes. These parameters were also investigated in white adipose tissue (WAT), muscle, and liver of mice chronically treated with ACEA. Moreover, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was investigated in WAT and isolated mature adipocytes from eNOS−/− and wild-type mice. eNOS, p38 MAPK, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mitochondrial biogenesis were investigated in WAT, muscle, and liver of HFD mice chronically treated with ACEA.

RESULTS
ACEA decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and eNOS expression, activated p38 MAPK, and reduced AMPK phosphorylation in white adipocytes. The ACEA effects on mitochondria were antagonized by nitric oxide donors and by p38 MAPK silencing. White adipocytes from eNOS−/− mice displayed higher p38 MAPK phosphorylation than wild-type animals under basal conditions, and ACEA was ineffective in cells lacking eNOS. Moreover, mitochondrial biogenesis was downregulated, while p38 MAPK phosphorylation was increased and AMPK phosphorylation was decreased in WAT, muscle, and liver of ACEA-treated mice on a HFD.

CONCLUSIONS
CB1 receptor stimulation decreases mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes, through eNOS downregulation and p38 MAPK activation, and impairs mitochondrial function in metabolically active tissues of dietary obese mice.},

	abstract = {Cannabis sativa is the source of a unique set of compounds known collectively as plant cannabinoids or phytocannabinoids. This review focuses on the manner with which three of these compounds, (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), (−)-cannabidiol (CBD) and (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ9-THCV), interact with cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. Δ9-THC, the main psychotropic constituent of cannabis, is a CB1 and CB2 receptor partial agonist and in line with classical pharmacology, the responses it elicits appear to be strongly influenced both by the expression level and signalling efficiency of cannabinoid receptors and by ongoing endogenous cannabinoid release. CBD displays unexpectedly high potency as an antagonist of CB1/CB2 receptor agonists in CB1- and CB2-expressing cells or tissues, the manner with which it interacts with CB2 receptors providing a possible explanation for its ability to inhibit evoked immune cell migration. Δ9-THCV behaves as a potent CB2 receptor partial agonist in vitro. In contrast, it antagonizes cannabinoid receptor agonists in CB1-expressing tissues. This it does with relatively high potency and in a manner that is both tissue and ligand dependent. Δ9-THCV also interacts with CB1 receptors when administered in vivo, behaving either as a CB1 antagonist or, at higher doses, as a CB1 receptor agonist. Brief mention is also made in this review, first of the production by Δ9-THC of pharmacodynamic tolerance, second of current knowledge about the extent to which Δ9-THC, CBD and Δ9-THCV interact with pharmacological targets other than CB1 or CB2 receptors, and third of actual and potential therapeutic applications for each of these cannabinoids.},

	abstract = {Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) has been initially described as the receptor for Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in the central nervous system (CNS), mediating retrograde synaptic signaling of the endocannabinoid system. Beside its expression in various CNS regions, CB1 is ubiquituous in peripheral tissues, where it mediates, among other activities, the cell's energy homeostasis. We sought to examine the role of CB1 in the context of the evolutionarily conserved autophagic machinery, a main constituent of the regulation of the intracellular energy status. Manipulating CB1 by siRNA knockdown in mammalian cells caused an elevated autophagic flux, while the expression of autophagy-related genes remained unaltered. Pharmacological inhibition of CB1 activity using Rimonabant likewise caused an elevated autophagic flux, which was independent of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, a major switch in the control of canonical autophagy. In addition, knocking down coiled-coil myosin-like BCL2-interacting protein 1, the key-protein of the second canonical autophagy control complex, was insufficient to reduce the elevated autophagic flux induced by Rimonabant. Interestingly, lysosomal activity is not altered, suggesting a specific effect of CB1 on the regulation of autophagic flux. We conclude that CB1 activity affects the autophagic flux independently of the two major canonic regulation complexes controlling autophagic vesicle formation.








Regulation of the autophagic flux in certain physiological situations such as an imbalance of nutrient supply as well as in pathological stages is of major importance for neuronal and non-neuronal cells. CB1 (Cannabinoid receptor 1) affects the metabolism of cells directly. In this study, we provide evidence that CB1 signaling has a direct influence on autophagy which might help the cell to find the right adjustment to different metabolic states and CB1 activity exerts its modulatory action independent of the canonical mTOR- and BECLIN1-complexes regulating autophagy.},

	abstract = {Objective
Although platinum-based chemotherapy is widely used in malignant pleural mesothelioma, its modest therapeutic effect warrants identification of enhancing agents. As with many cancers, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is often activated in malignant pleural mesothelioma and has been implicated in the tumor's aggressiveness. Sirolimus is a well-established inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin. We sought to determine whether combination treatment with sirolimus and cisplatin would enhance cell death in malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Methods
Human malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines were incubated with sirolimus or cisplatin alone or in combination and assayed for cell viability. To characterize phosphorylation status after treatment, Akt and downstream proteins of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, were analyzed by Western blot. Effect of combination treatment was also analyzed with extreme drug resistance assay in 12 human malignant pleural mesothelioma tumors with varying resistance to cisplatin.
Results
Individual malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines exhibited a range of sensitivities to each drug without correlation with subtype. Sirolimus and cisplatin significantly (P = .029) increased cell death versus either drug alone in 4 cell lines. Combined treatment caused dephosphorylation of Akt, 4E-BP1, and p70 S6 kinase. Cell proliferation was significantly decreased in tumors subjected to sirolimus and cisplatin versus cisplatin or sirolimus alone.
Conclusions
Sirolimus appears to enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines through the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. These results provide a basis for the clinical evaluation of combined sirolimus and cisplatin chemotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma.},

Emerging data associate impaired autophagy, increased activity in the endocannabinoid system, and upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) protein expression during intestinal inflammation. We have investigated whether these three processes are linked. By assessing the impact of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), the synthetic cannabinoid arachidonyl-2′-chloroethylamide (ACEA), and the endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) on autophagosome formation, we explored whether these actions were responsible for cyclic SOCS3 protein levels. Our findings show that all three cannabinoids induce autophagy in a dose-dependent manner in fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, a model of mature intestinal epithelium. ACEA and AEA induced canonical autophagy, which was cannabinoid type 1 receptor-mediated. In contrast, CBD was able to bypass the cannabinoid type 1 receptor and the canonical pathway to induce autophagy, albeit to a lesser extent. Functionally, all three cannabinoids reduced SOCS3 protein expression, which was reversed by blocking early and late autophagy. In conclusion, the regulatory protein SOCS3 is regulated by autophagy, and cannabinoids play a role in this process, which could be important when therapeutic applications for the cannabinoids in inflammatory conditions are considered.},

Anecdotal and scientific evidence suggests that Cannabis use may have a positive impact in IBD patients. Here, we investigated the effect of cannabigerol (CBG), a non-psychotropic Cannabis-derived cannabinoid, in a murine model of colitis. Colitis was induced in mice by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (DNBS). Inflammation was assessed by evaluating inflammatory markers/parameters (colon weight/colon length ratio and myeloperoxidase activity), by histological analysis and immunohistochemistry; interleukin-1β, interleukin-10 and interferon-γ levels by ELISA, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by western blot and RT-PCR; CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity by a colorimetric assay. Murine macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells were used to evaluate the effect of CBG on nitric oxide production and oxidative stress, respectively. CBG reduced colon weight/colon length ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, and iNOS expression, increased SOD activity and normalized interleukin-1β, interleukin-10 and interferon-γ changes associated to DNBS administration. In macrophages, CBG reduced nitric oxide production and iNOS protein (but not mRNA) expression. Rimonabant (a CB1 receptor antagonist) did not change the effect of CBG on nitric oxide production, while SR144528 (a CB2 receptor antagonist) further increased the inhibitory effect of CBG on nitric oxide production. In conclusion, CBG attenuated murine colitis, reduced nitric oxide production in macrophages (effect being modulated by the CB2 receptor) and reduced ROS formation in intestinal epithelial cells. CBG could be considered for clinical experimentation in IBD patients.},

	abstract = {The recent identification of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous lipid ligands has triggered an exponential growth of studies exploring the endocannabinoid system and its regulatory functions in health and disease. Such studies have been greatly facilitated by the introduction of selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists and inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolism and transport, as well as mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors or the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amidohydrolase. In the past decade, the endocannabinoid system has been implicated in a growing number of physiological functions, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in peripheral organs. More importantly, modulating the activity of the endocannabinoid system turned out to hold therapeutic promise in a wide range of disparate diseases and pathological conditions, ranging from mood and anxiety disorders, movement disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, to cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, glaucoma, obesity/metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis, to name just a few. An impediment to the development of cannabinoid medications has been the socially unacceptable psychoactive properties of plant-derived or synthetic agonists, mediated by CB1 receptors. However, this problem does not arise when the therapeutic aim is achieved by treatment with a CB1 receptor antagonist, such as in obesity, and may also be absent when the action of endocannabinoids is enhanced indirectly through blocking their metabolism or transport. The use of selective CB2 receptor agonists, which lack psychoactive properties, could represent another promising avenue for certain conditions. The abuse potential of plant-derived cannabinoids may also be limited through the use of preparations with controlled composition and the careful selection of dose and route of administration. The growing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials with compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system will probably result in novel therapeutic approaches in a number of diseases for which current treatments do not fully address the patients' need. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview on the current state of knowledge of the endocannabinoid system as a target of pharmacotherapy.},

	abstract = {Background

Cachexia and muscle atrophy are common consequences of cancer and chemotherapy administration. The novel hormone ghrelin has been proposed as a treatment for this condition. Increases in food intake and direct effects on muscle proteolysis and protein synthesis are likely to mediate these effects, but the pathways leading to these events are not well understood.

Methods

We characterized molecular pathways involved in muscle atrophy induced by Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumour implantation in c57/bl6 adult male mice and by administration of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin in mice and in C2C12 myotubes. The effects of exogenous ghrelin administration and its mechanisms of action were examined in these settings.

Results

Tumour implantation and cisplatin induced muscle atrophy by activating pro-inflammatory cytokines, p38-C/EBP-β, and myostatin, and by down-regulating Akt, myoD, and myogenin, leading to activation of ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis and muscle weakness. Tumour implantation also increased mortality. In vitro, cisplatin up-regulated myostatin and atrogin-1 by activating C/EBP-β and FoxO1/3. Ghrelin prevented these changes in vivo and in vitro, significantly increasing muscle mass (P {\textless} 0.05 for LLC and P {\textless} 0.01 for cisplatin models) and grip strength (P = 0.038 for LLC and P = 0.001 for cisplatin models) and improving survival (P = 0.021 for LLC model).

Conclusion

Ghrelin prevents muscle atrophy by down-regulating inflammation, p38/C/EBP-β/myostatin, and activating Akt, myogenin, and myoD. These changes appear, at least in part, to target muscle cells directly. Ghrelin administration in this setting is associated with improved muscle strength and survival.},

These side effects not only compromise patient's quality of life (QOL), but also diminish physical activity, resulting in limited treatment and increased morbidity. Recent Advances: Oxidative stress, mediated by cancer or chemotherapeutic agents, is an underlying mechanism of the drug-induced toxicity. Nontargeted tissues, such as striated muscle, are severely affected by oxidative stress during chemotherapy, leading to toxicity and dysfunction. Critical Issues: These findings highlight the importance of investigating clinically applicable interventions to alleviate the debilitating side effects. This article discusses the clinically available chemotherapy drugs that cause fatigue and oxidative stress in cancer patients, with an in-depth focus on the anthracycline doxorubicin. Doxorubicin, an effective anticancer drug, is a primary example of how chemotherapeutic agents disrupt striated muscle function through oxidative stress.

FoxO transcription factors promote autophagy in skeletal muscle and have additional roles in regulation of cell size, proliferation, and metabolism. Here we investigate the role of FoxO transcription factors in regulating autophagy and cell size in cardiomyocytes. In cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, glucose deprivation leads to decreased cell size and induction of autophagy pathway genes LC3, Gabarapl1, and Atg12. Likewise, overexpression of either FoxO1 or FoxO3 reduces cardiomyocyte cell size and induces expression of autophagy pathway genes. Moreover, inhibition of FoxO activity by dominant negative FoxO1 (Δ256) blocks cardiomyocyte cell size reduction upon starvation, suggesting the necessity of FoxO function in cardiomyocyte cell size regulation. Under starvation conditions, endogenous FoxO1 and FoxO3 are localized to the nucleus and bind to promoter sequences of Gabarapl1 and Atg12. In vivo studies show that cellular stress, such as starvation or ischemia/reperfusion in mice, results in induction of autophagy in the heart with concomitant dephosphorylation of FoxO, consistent with increased activity of nuclear FoxO transcription factors. Together these results provide evidence for an important role for FoxO1 and FoxO3 in regulating autophagy and cell size in cardiomyocytes.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing 32 (TRIM32) are responsible for the disease limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2H (LGMD2H). Previously, we generated Trim32 knockout mice (Trim32-/- mice) and showed that they display a myopathic phenotype accompanied by neurogenic features. Here, we used these mice to investigate the muscle-specific defects arising from the absence of TRIM32, which underlie the myopathic phenotype. Using 2 models of induced atrophy, we showed that TRIM32 is dispensable for muscle atrophy. Conversely, TRIM32 was necessary for muscle regrowth after atrophy. Furthermore, TRIM32-deficient primary myoblasts underwent premature senescence and impaired myogenesis due to accumulation of PIAS4, an E3 SUMO ligase and TRIM32 substrate that was previously shown to be associated with senescence. Premature senescence of myoblasts was also observed in vivo in an atrophy/regrowth model. Trim32-/- muscles had substantially fewer activated satellite cells, increased PIAS4 levels, and growth failure compared with wild-type muscles. Moreover, Trim32-/- muscles exhibited features of premature sarcopenia, such as selective type II fast fiber atrophy. These results imply that premature senescence of muscle satellite cells is an underlying pathogenic feature of LGMD2H and reveal what we believe to be a new mechanism of muscular dystrophy associated with reductions in available satellite cells and premature sarcopenia.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of muscle, and how anabolic and catabolic stimuli interact to control muscle mass and function, have led to new interest in the pharmacological treatment of muscle wasting. Loss of muscle occurs as a consequence of several chronic diseases (cachexia) as well as normal aging (sarcopenia). Although many negative regulators [Atrogin-1, muscle ring finger-1, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), myostatin, etc.] have been proposed to enhance protein degradation during both sarcopenia and cachexia, the adaptation of mediators markedly differs among these conditions. Sarcopenic and cachectic muscles have been demonstrated to be abundant in myostatin- and apoptosis-linked molecules. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is activated during many different types of cachexia (cancer cachexia, cardiac heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), but not many mediators of the UPS change during sarcopenia. NF-κB signaling is activated in cachectic, but not in sarcopenic, muscle. Some studies have indicated a change of autophagic signaling during both sarcopenia and cachexia, but the adaptation remains to be elucidated. This review provides an overview of the adaptive changes in negative regulators of muscle mass in both sarcopenia and cachexia.},

Denervation is an effective disuse model which functions to change the intracellular environment of muscle leading to a rapid loss in mass, a decrease in mitochondrial content, and an elevation in both pro-apoptotic protein expression and myonuclear apoptosis. Recent investigations have shown that alternative degradation pathways such as autophagy are activated in conjunction with apoptosis during chronic muscle disuse. We have previously shown that 7 days of muscle disuse increases the expression of Beclin 1. Furthermore, we have also detected a significant increase in the expression of LC3-II, a known component of autophagy. In addition to its upregulation, denervation appears to induce the translocation of LC3-II to mitochondrial membranes. Collectively, these increases in protein expression suggest that autophagy signaling is upregulated in response to denervation, and that these pathways may preferentially target mitochondria for degradation in skeletal muscle.},

The underlying mechanisms are still unclear, although the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been involved in the degradation of bulk myofibrillar proteins. The present work has been aimed to investigate whether autophagic degradation also plays a role in the onset of muscle depletion in cancer-bearing animals and in glucocorticoid-induced atrophy and sarcopenia of aging. The results show that autophagy is induced in muscle in three different models of cancer cachexia and in glucocorticoid-treated mice. In contrast, autophagic degradation in the muscle of sarcopenic animals is impaired but can be reactivated by calorie restriction. These results further demonstrate that different mechanisms are involved in pathologic muscle wasting and that autophagy, either excessive or defective, contributes to the complicated network that leads to muscle atrophy. In this regard, particularly intriguing is the observation that in cancer hosts and tumor necrosis factor α–treated C2C12 myotubes, insulin can only partially blunt autophagy induction. This finding suggests that autophagy is triggered through mechanisms that cannot be circumvented by using classic upstream modulators, prompting us to identify more effective approaches to target this proteolytic system.},

We find that cell growth and cell cycle progression are separable processes in mammalian cells and that growth to appropriate cell size requires mTOR- and PI3K-dependent signals. Expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of mTOR rescues the reduced cell size phenotype induced by rapamycin in a kinase-dependent manner, showing the evolutionarily conserved role of mTOR in control of cell growth. Expression of S6K1 mutants that possess partial rapamycin-resistant activity or overexpression of eIF4E individually and additively partially rescues the rapamycin-induced decrease in cell size. In the absence of rapamycin, overexpression of S6K1 or eIF4E increases cell size, and, when coexpressed, they cooperate to increase cell size further. Expression of a phosphorylation site-defective mutant of 4EBP1 that constitutively binds the eIF4E–Cap complex to inhibit translation initiation reduces cell size and blocks eIF4E effects on cell size. These data show that mTOR signals downstream to at least two independent targets, S6K1 and 4EBP1/eIF4E, that function in translational control to regulate mammalian cell size.},

In this study we examine the function of muscle in the myostatin null mouse which is an excellent model for hypertrophy beyond levels of normal growth and consequeces of acute starvation to restore mass. We show that muscle growth is sustained through protein synthesis driven by Serum/Glucocorticoid Kinase 1 (SGK1) rather than Akt1. Furthermore our metabonomic profiling of hypertrophic muscle shows that carbon from nutrient sources is being channelled for the production of biomass rather than ATP production. However the muscle displays elevated levels of autophagy and decreased levels of muscle tension. We demonstrate the myostatin null muscle is acutely sensitive to changes in diet and activates both the proteolytic and autophagy programmes and shutting down protein synthesis more extensively than is the case for wild-types. Poignantly we show that acute starvation which is detrimental to wild-type animals is beneficial in terms of metabolism and muscle function in the myostatin null mice by normalising tension production.},

The progressive loss of muscle strength during aging is a common degenerative event of unclear pathogenesis. Although muscle functional decline precedes age-related changes in other tissues, its contribution to systemic aging is unknown. Here, we show that muscle aging is characterized in Drosophila by the progressive accumulation of protein aggregates that associate with impaired muscle function. The transcription factor FOXO and its target 4E-BP remove damaged proteins at least in part via the autophagy/lysosome system, whereas foxo mutants have dysfunctional proteostasis. Both FOXO and 4E-BP delay muscle functional decay and extend life span. Moreover, FOXO/4E-BP signaling in muscles decreases feeding behavior and the release of insulin from producing cells, which in turn delays the age-related accumulation of protein aggregates in other tissues. These findings reveal an organism-wide regulation of proteostasis in response to muscle aging and a key role of FOXO/4E-BP signaling in the coordination of organismal and tissue aging.},

This work suggests that rather than promoting death, BNIP3 may actually allow survival either by preventing ATP depletion or by eliminating damaged mitochondria. However, the function of BNIP3 may be subverted under unusual conditions associated with acidosis that arise following extended periods of hypoxia and anaerobic glycolysis. Despite this novel insight into BNIP3 function, much remains to be done in terms of pinning down a molecular activity for BNIP3 that explains both its role in autophagy and how this may be subverted to induce cell death. As a target of the RB tumor suppressor, our work also places BNIP3 at the center of efforts to exploit autophagy to better treat human cancers in which tumor hypoxia is implicated as a progression factor.},

The list of newly discovered molecules that regulate the maturation of autophagosomes to degradative autolysosomes includes the AAA ATPase SKD1, the small GTP binding protein Rab7, and possibly also the Alzheimer-linked presenilin 1. This review combines previous data on the endo/lysosomal fusion steps during autophagic vacuole maturation with recent findings on the molecules regulating these fusion steps. Interestingly, autophagic vacuole maturation appears to be blocked in certain human diseases including neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and Danon disease. This suggests that autophagy has important housekeeping or protective functions because a block in autophagic maturation causes a disease.},

In this study, we have used small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microarray analysis to provide the first whole-genome analysis of genes regulated by ATF4 in cancer cells in response to severe and prolonged hypoxic stress. We show that ATF4 is required for ER stress and hypoxia-induced expansion of autophagy. MAP1LC3B (LC3B) is a key component of the autophagosomal membrane, and in this study we demonstrate that ATF4 facilitates autophagy through direct binding to a cyclic AMP response element binding site in the LC3B promoter, resulting in LC3B upregulation. Previously, we have shown that Bortezomib-induced ATF4 stabilization, which then upregulated LC3B expression and had a critical role in activating autophagy, protecting cells from Bortezomib-induced cell death. We also showed that severe hypoxia stabilizes ATF4. In this study, we demonstrate that severe hypoxia leads to ER stress and induces ATF4-dependent autophagy through LC3 as a survival mechanism. In summary, we show that ATF4 has a key role in the regulation of autophagy in response to ER stress and provide a direct mechanistic link between the UPR and the autophagic machinery.},

The inhibition of the 26S proteasome by Bortezomib leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress followed by a coordinated cellular response called unfolded protein response (UPR). Endoplasmic reticulum stress is also a potent inducer of macroautophagy. Bortezomib is a selective and potent inhibitor of the 26S proteasome and is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Clinical trials with Bortezomib have shown promising results for some types of cancers, but not for some others, including those of the breast. In this study, we show that Bortezomib induces the UPR and autophagy in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Surprisingly, Bortezomib did not induce phosphorylation of PERK, a key initial step of the UPR. We show that induction of autophagy by Bortezomib is dependent on the proteasomal stabilisation of ATF4 and up-regulation of LC3B by ATF4. We show that ATF4 and LC3B play a critical role in activating autophagy and protecting cells from Bortezomib-induced cell death. Our experiments also reveal that HDAC6 knockdown results in decreased LC3B protein and reduced autophagy. Our work shows that the induction of autophagy through ATF4 may be an important resistance mechanism to Bortezomib treatment in breast cancer, and targeting autophagy may represent a novel approach to sensitize breast cancers to Bortezomib.

	abstract = {Mammalian cell homeostasis during starvation depends on initiation of autophagy by endoplasmic reticulum-localized phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) synthesis. Formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that engulf cytosolic components requires the LC3-conjugating Atg12–5-16L1 complex. The molecular mechanisms of Atg12–5-16L1 recruitment and significance of PtdIns(3)P synthesis at autophagosome formation sites are unknown. By identifying interacting partners of WIPIs, WD-repeat PtdIns(3)P effector proteins, we found that Atg16L1 directly binds WIPI2b. Mutation experiments and ectopic localization of WIPI2b to plasma membrane show that WIPI2b is a PtdIns(3)P effector upstream of Atg16L1 and is required for LC3 conjugation and starvation-induced autophagy through recruitment of the Atg12–5-16L1 complex. Atg16L1 mutants, which do not bind WIPI2b but bind FIP200, cannot rescue starvation-induced autophagy in Atg16L1-deficient MEFs. WIPI2b is also required for autophagic clearance of pathogenic bacteria. WIPI2b binds the membrane surrounding Salmonella and recruits the Atg12–5-16L1 complex, initiating LC3 conjugation, autophagosomal membrane formation, and engulfment of Salmonella.,

Dooley et al. demonstrate that the PtdIns(3)P effector WIPI2b binds Atg16L1 to recruit Atg12–5-16L1 to PtdIns(3)P-positive omegasomes, resulting in LC3 lipidation and starvation-induced autophagy. These findings suggest that WIPI2b senses increases in PtdIns(3)P and directs LC3 conjugation to developing autophagosomes.},

The nutrient and energy sensors mTORC1 and AMPK signal directly to the ULK complex and affect its activity. Formation and activation of distinct Beclin1–PI3KC3 complexes produces PI3P, a signaling lipid required for the recruitment of autophagy effectors.

	abstract = {Protein degradation by basal constitutive autophagy is important to avoid accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and development of neurodegenerative diseases. The polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 is degraded by autophagy. It is found in cellular inclusion bodies together with polyubiquitinated proteins and in cytosolic protein aggregates that accumulate in various chronic, toxic, and degenerative diseases. Here we show for the first time a direct interaction between p62 and the autophagic effector proteins LC3A and -B and the related γ-aminobutyrate receptor-associated protein and γ-aminobutyrate receptor-associated-like proteins. The binding is mediated by a 22-residue sequence of p62 containing an evolutionarily conserved motif. To monitor the autophagic sequestration of p62- and LC3-positive bodies, we developed a novel pH-sensitive fluorescent tag consisting of a tandem fusion of the red, acid-insensitive mCherry and the acid-sensitive green fluorescent proteins. This approach revealed that p62- and LC3-positive bodies are degraded in autolysosomes. Strikingly, even rather large p62-positive inclusion bodies (2 μm diameter) become degraded by autophagy. The specific interaction between p62 and LC3, requiring the motif we have mapped, is instrumental in mediating autophagic degradation of the p62-positive bodies. We also demonstrate that the previously reported aggresome-like induced structures containing ubiquitinated proteins in cytosolic bodies are dependent on p62 for their formation. In fact, p62 bodies and these structures are indistinguishable. Taken together, our results clearly suggest that p62 is required both for the formation and the degradation of polyubiquitin-containing bodies by autophagy.},

A machinery of pro-fusion and fission proteins regulates their morphology and subcellular localization. In muscle this results in an orderly pattern of intermyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria. Muscular atrophy is a genetically controlled process involving the activation of the autophagy-lysosome and the ubiquitin–proteasome systems. Whether and how the mitochondria are involved in muscular atrophy is unknown. Here, we show that the mitochondria are removed through autophagy system and that changes in mitochondrial network occur in atrophying muscles. Expression of the fission machinery is per se sufficient to cause muscle wasting in adult animals, by triggering organelle dysfunction and AMPK activation. Conversely, inhibition of the mitochondrial fission inhibits muscle loss during fasting and after FoxO3 overexpression. Mitochondrial-dependent muscle atrophy requires AMPK activation as inhibition of AMPK restores muscle size in myofibres with altered mitochondria. Thus, disruption of the mitochondrial network is an essential amplificatory loop of the muscular atrophy programme.},

	abstract = {MyoD controls myoblast identity and differentiation and is required for myogenic stem cell function in adult skeletal muscle. MyoD is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediated by different E3 ubiquitin ligases not identified as yet. Here we report that MyoD interacts with Atrogin-1/MAFbx (MAFbx), a striated muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase dramatically up-regulated in atrophying muscle. A core LXXLL motif sequence in MyoD is necessary for binding to MAFbx. MAFbx associates with MyoD through an inverted LXXLL motif located in a series of helical leucine-charged residue-rich domains. Mutation in the LXXLL core motif represses ubiquitination and degradation of MyoD induced by MAFbx. Overexpression of MAFbx suppresses MyoD-induced differentiation and inhibits myotube formation. Finally the purified recombinant SCFMAFbx complex (SCF, Skp1, Cdc53/Cullin 1, F-box protein) mediated MyoD ubiquitination in vitro in a lysine-dependent pathway. Mutation of the lysine 133 in MyoD prevented its ubiquitination by the recombinant SCFMAFbx complex. These observations thus demonstrated that MAFbx functions in ubiquitinating MyoD via a sequence found in transcriptional coactivators. These transcriptional coactivators mediate the binding to liganded nuclear receptors. We also identified a novel protein-protein interaction module not yet identified in F-box proteins. MAFbx may play an important role in the course of muscle differentiation by determining the abundance of MyoD.},

	abstract = {Objective: In chronic heart failure (CHF) the myocardial expression of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which is thought to contribute to myocardial remodeling, was found to be increased. However, it is unknown whether the E3-ubiquitin ligases MAFbx and Murf-1 are involved in this remodeling process and whether their expression is regulated by TNF-α.Methods: Rats underwent ligation of the left coronary artery to induce CHF or were sham-operated. The expression of MAFbx/Murf-1 and troponin I was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting in the non-infarcted area of the left ventricle. In cell culture experiments the potency of TNF-α to stimulate Murf-1/MAFbx expression, the intracellular signaling pathway, and the involvement of the E3-ligases for the impairment of contractility were assessed.Results: In CHF the myocardial expression of TNF-α was elevated 3.1-fold as compared to control. This was associated with a 4.5-fold and 2.7-fold increase in MAFbx and Murf-1 expression, respectively. A positive correlation between TNF-α and the expression of MAFbx or Murf-1 was evident. In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, TNF-α induced the expression of MAFbx through p38MAPK-dependent pathways, whereas the induction of Murf-1 required the activation of the p42/44 MAPK pathway. Exposure of cardiomyocytes to TNF-α resulted in troponin I ubiquitinylation, subsequent degradation, and a decline in contractility. This was completely abrogated by siRNAs against Murf-1/MAFbx.Conclusion: TNF-α, which is increasingly expressed in CHF, induces troponin I degradation through a MAFbx/Murf-1-dependent pathway. This was associated with an impairment of contractility and might be one mechanism involved in the adverse remodeling process in CHF.},

To identify key factors in this process, we have used cDNA microarrays to compare normal and atrophying muscles and found a unique gene fragment that is induced more than ninefold in muscles of fasted mice. We cloned this gene, which is expressed specifically in striated muscles. Because this mRNA also markedly increases in muscles atrophying because of diabetes, cancer, and renal failure, we named it atrogin-1. It contains a functional F-box domain that binds to Skp1 and thereby to Roc1 and Cul1, the other components of SCF-type Ub-protein ligases (E3s), as well as a nuclear localization sequence and PDZ-binding domain. On fasting, atrogin-1 mRNA levels increase specifically in skeletal muscle and before atrophy occurs. Atrogin-1 is one of the few examples of an F-box protein or Ub-protein ligase (E3) expressed in a tissue-specific manner and appears to be a critical component in the enhanced proteolysis leading to muscle atrophy in diverse diseases.},

	abstract = {Autophagy plays an important role in cellular quality control and is responsible for removing protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles. Bnip3 is an atypical BH3-only protein that is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Interestingly, Bnip3 can also protect against cell death by inducing mitochondrial autophagy. The mechanism for this process, however, remains poorly understood. Bnip3 contains a C-terminal transmembrane domain that is essential for homodimerization and proapoptotic function. In this study, we show that homodimerization of Bnip3 is also a requirement for induction of autophagy. Several Bnip3 mutants that do not interfere with its mitochondrial localization but disrupt homodimerization failed to induce autophagy in cells. In addition, we discovered that endogenous Bnip3 is localized to both mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To investigate the effects of Bnip3 at mitochondria or the ER on autophagy, Bnip3 was targeted specifically to each organelle by substituting the Bnip3 transmembrane domain with that of Acta or cytochrome b5. We found that Bnip3 enhanced autophagy in cells from both sites. We also discovered that Bnip3 induced removal of both ER (ERphagy) and mitochondria (mitophagy) via autophagy. The clearance of these organelles was mediated in part via binding of Bnip3 to LC3 on the autophagosome. Although ablation of the Bnip3-LC3 interaction by mutating the LC3 binding site did not impair the prodeath activity of Bnip3, it significantly reduced both mitophagy and ERphagy. Our data indicate that Bnip3 regulates the apoptotic balance as an autophagy receptor that induces removal of both mitochondria and ER.},

Over 2 days cisplatin (6 mg/kg i.p.) reduced food intake, stimulated kaolin consumption, increased the wet weight of gastric contents and reduced locomotor activity.

Making use of a proteomic approach, we investigated the effects of acute swimming exercise (ASE) on protein expression and carbonylation patterns in two hind limb muscles: the Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) and the Soleus, mostly composed of fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibres, respectively. Carbonylation is one of the most common oxidative modifications of proteins and a marker of oxidative stress. In fact, several studies suggest that physical activity and the consequent increase in oxygen consumption can lead to increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) production, hence the interest in examining the impact of RONS on skeletal muscle proteins following ASE. Results indicate that protein expression is unaffected by ASE in both muscle types. Unexpectedly, the protein carbonylation level was reduced following ASE. In particular, the analysis found 31 and 5 spots, in Soleus and EDL muscles respectively, whose carbonylation is reduced after ASE. Lipid peroxidation levels in Soleus were markedly reduced as well. Most of the decarbonylated proteins are involved either in the regulation of muscle contractions or in the regulation of energy metabolism. A number of hypotheses may be advanced to account for such results, which will be addressed in future studies.},

Here we have identified IκB kinase α (IKKα) as a novel substrate of SGK1 by using biochemical and bioinformatic approaches. SGK1 directly phosphorylates IKKα at Thr-23 and indirectly activates IKKα at Ser-180. Furthermore, SGK1 enhanced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity and up-regulated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2A and NR2B expression through activation of IKKα at Thr-23 and Ser-180, and these two residues play an equally important role in mediating these effects of SGK1. Although SGK1 does not phosphorylate IKKβ, IKKβ activity is still required for IKK complex activation and for SGK1 phosphorylation and activation of NF-κB. In addition, SGK1 increased the acetylation of NF-κB through phosphorylation of p300 at Ser-1834, and this also leads to NF-κB activation and NR2A and NR2B expression. Moreover, an endogenous stimulus of SGK1, insulin, increased IKKα and NF-κB phosphorylation as well as NF-κB acetylation and NF-κB activity, but SGK1 small interfering RNA transfection blocked these effects of insulin. In examination of the functional significance of the SGK1-IKKα-NF-κB signaling pathway, we found that transfection of the IKKα double mutant (IKKαT23A/S180A) to rat hippocampus antagonized SGK-1-mediated spatial memory facilitation. Our results together demonstrated novel substrate proteins of SGK1 and novel SGK1 signaling pathways. Activation of these signaling pathways enhances NR2A and NR2B expression that is implicated in neuronal plasticity.},

The present study explored whether SGK1 and NDRG1 play a role in the regulation of NF-κB and DC-maturation.
METHODS: DCs were isolated from bone marrow (BMDCs) or spleen of mice lacking functional SGK1 (sgk1(-/-)) and corresponding wild type mice (sgk1(+/+)). Protein abundance was determined by Western blotting. Transcription was inhibited by siRNA. Abundance of maturation markers was quantified by flow cytometry. FITC-dextran uptake was determined to quantify phagocytosis.
RESULTS: NDRG1 was similarly expressed in sgk1(+/+) and sgk1(-/-)BMDCs, but SGK1-dependent phosphorylation of NDRG-1 was decreased in sgk1(-/-)BMDCs. Silencing of NDRG1 in sgk1(+/+)BMDCs as compared to control empty vector-treated BMDCs enhanced nuclear abundance of NF-κB subunit p65. Moreover, the abundance of phosphorylated NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, of phosphorylated IκB kinase (IKKα/β) and of nuclear p65 were significantly higher in sgk1(-/-)BMDCs than in sgk1(+/+)BMDCs. Expression of maturation markers, MHC II, and CD86, was significantly larger and phagocytic capacity was significantly lower in sgk1(-/-) than in sgk1(+/+)BMDCs. Expression of CD86 and MHCII was also significantly higher in DCs isolated from the spleen of sgk1(-/-) mice than those from sgk1(+/+)mice.
CONCLUSION: SGK1 and NDRG1 participate in the regulation of NF-κB signaling in and maturation of DCs.},

Here we compare the ability of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatimum[II]) to induce DNA adducts in both genomic and mtDNA of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in culture. Cytotoxicity was examined by cell survival 4, 8 and 24 h afer exposure to 50 μM cisplatin. Cisplatin-DNA adducts were measured in DNA from nuclear and mitochondrial fractions by dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassay (DELFIA), a sensitive competitive microtiter-based immunoassay utilizing antiserum elicited against cisplatin-modified DNA. An additional comparison of cisplatin-DNA binding in both compartments was performed by immunoelectron microscopy using the cisplatin-DNA antiserum and colloidal gold. DELFIA analysis of cisplatin-DNA adducts in gDNA and mtDNA showed a six-fold higher incorporation of drug into mtDNA as compared to gDNA. Morphometric studies of colloidal gold distribution in photomicrographs of CHO cells showed mtDNA to contain a four-fold higher concentration of cisplatin as compared to nuclear DNA. Therefore, both methods demonstrated a preferential binding of cisplatin to mtDNA versus gDNA.},

Expression of NOS2 in macrophages is controlled by cytokines and microbial products, primarily by transcriptional induction. NOS2 has been documented in macrophages from human, horse, cow, goat, sheep, rat, mouse, and chicken. Human NOS2 is most readily observed in monocytes or macrophages from patients with infectious or inflammatory diseases. Sustained production of NO endows macrophages with cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, and tumor cells. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic actions of NO are enhanced by other macrophage products such as acid, glutathione, cysteine, hydrogen peroxide, or superoxide. Although the high-output NO pathway probably evolved to protect the host from infection, suppressive effects on lymphocyte proliferation and damage to other normal host cells confer upon NOS2 the same protective/destructive duality inherent in every other major component of the immune response.},

We have used rat as the model to evaluate the effect of cisplatin on liver antioxidant enzymes and to determine whether these modulations in enzymatic activities are involved in hepatotoxicity. Reports obtained from our study indicate that cisplatin increases lipid peroxidation in the treated tissue of rat. The drug is also involved in altering the thiol status of the tissue with concomitant alterations in the enzymatic antioxidants. Glutathione and glutathione reductase levels were significantly decreased after cisplatin therapy, whereas glutathione peroxidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and catalase showed a significant increase. No statistically significant change was observed in glutathione-S-transferase activity. After cisplatin treatment, cytochrome P 450 showed a significant increase, whereas cytochrome b5 was decreased. Thus, an alteration in enzymatic antioxidant status with increase in lipid peroxidation indicates that the enzymes play an important role in combating free radical induced oxidative stress on the tissue.},

ROS generation in cisplatin-treated HEI-OC1 auditory cells was also correlated with changing mitochondrial membrane potential. However, the roles of NADPH oxidase in cisplatin-induced ROS generation and ototoxicity have not been fully elucidated. Herein, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that treatment of cisplatin induced the expression of NADPH oxidase isoforms NOX-1 and NOX-4 in HEI-OC1 auditory cells. Expression of mRNA for NOX-1, NOX-4, NOXO1, NOXA1, p47phox, and p67phox was also increased. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase with diphenyleniodonium chloride or apocynin abolished ROS production and the subsequent apoptotic cell death in cisplatin-treated cells. Furthermore, suppression of NOX1 and NOX4 expression by small interfering RNA transfection markedly abolished the cytotoxicity and ROS generation by cisplatin. Together, our data suggest that ROS generated, in part, through the activation of NADPH oxidase plays an essential role in cisplatin ototoxicity.},

A major mechanism underlying the development of mitochondria-related diseases is thought to be an increase in intracellular oxidative stress produced by impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). However, clear evidence of intracellular free radical generation has not been clearly provided for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-damaged cells. In this study, using the novel fluorescence dye, 2-[6-(4′-hydroxy)phenoxy-3H-xanthen-3-on-9-yl]benzoic acid (HPF), which was designed to detect hydroxyl radicals (·OH), intracellular free radical formation was examined in 143B cells (parental cells), 143B-ρ0 cells (mtDNA-lacking cells), 87 wt (cybrid), and cybrids of 4977-bp mtDNA deletion (common deletion) cells containing the deletion with 0\%, 5\%, 50\% and \&gt;99\% frequency (HeLacot, BH5, BH50 and BH3.12, respectively), using a laser confocal microscope detection method. ETC inhibitors (rotenone, 3-nitropropionic acid, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, antimycin A and sodium cyanide) were also tested to determine whether inhibitor treatment increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. A significant increase in ROS for 143B-ρ0 cells was observed compared with 143B cells. However, for the 87 wt cybrid, no increase was observed. An increase was also observed in the mtDNA-deleted cells BH50 and BH3.12. The ETC inhibitors increased intracellular ROS in both 143B and 143B-ρ0 cells. Furthermore, in every fluorescence image, the fluorescence dye appeared localized around the nuclei. To clarify the localization, we double-stained cells with the dye and MitoTracker Red. The resulting fluorescence was consistently located in mitochondria. Furthermore, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) cDNA-transfected cells had decreased ROS. These results suggest that more ROS are generated from mitochondria in ETC-inhibited and mtDNA-damaged cells, which have impaired ETC.},

We report that specific autophagy inhibition in muscle has a major impact on neuromuscular synaptic function and, consequently, on muscle strength, ultimately affecting the lifespan of animals. Inhibition of autophagy also exacerbates aging phenotypes in muscle, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and profound weakness. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress directly affect acto-myosin interaction and force generation but show a limited effect on stability of neuromuscular synapses. These results demonstrate that age-related deterioration of synaptic structure and function is exacerbated by defective autophagy.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is critically involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation. Data in the present study suggest that the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease protein, ataxin-3 (AT3), functions in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. AT3 contains an ubiquitin interaction motif (UIM) domain that binds polyubiquitylated proteins with a strong preference for chains containing four or more ubiquitins. Mutating the conserved leucine in the first UIM (L229A) almost totally eliminates binding to polyubiquitin chains while a similar mutation in the second UIM (L249A) also inhibits binding to polyubiquitin chains but to a lesser extent. Both wild-type and pathological AT3 increase cellular levels of a short-lived GFP that is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. AT3 has several properties characteristic of ubiquitin proteases including decreasing polyubiquitylation of 125I-lysozyme by removing ubiquitin from polyubiquitin chains, cleaving a ubiquitin protease substrate, and binding the specific ubiquitin protease inhibitor, ubiquitin-aldehyde. Mutating the predicted catalytic cysteine in AT3 inhibits each of these ubiquitin protease activities. The ability to bind and cleave ubiquitylated proteins is consistent with AT3 playing a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This raises the possibility that pathological AT3, which tends to misfold and aggregate, may be exposed to aggregate-prone misfolded/denatured proteins as part of its normal function.},

The protein encoded by dystrophin is a huge cytosolic protein that links the intracellular F-actin filaments to the members of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-complex (DGC). Dystrophin deficiency results in the absence or reduction of complex components that are degraded through an unknown pathway. We show here that muscle degeneration in a Caenorhabditis elegans DMD model is efficiently reduced by downregulation of chn-1, encoding the homologue of the human E3/E4 ubiquitylation enzyme CHIP. A deletion mutant of chn-1 delays the cell death of body-wall muscle cells and improves the motility of animals carrying mutations in dystrophin and MyoD. Elimination of chn-1 function in the musculature, but not in the nervous system, is sufficient for this effect, and can be phenocopied by proteasome inhibitor treatment. This suggests a critical role of CHIP/CHN-1-mediated ubiquitylation in the control of muscle wasting and degeneration and identifies a potential new drug target for the treatment of this disease.},

This system is well-known for its basic regulatory function in protein degradation, and controls a magnitude of key events.

	abstract = {Background
During the course of normal cellular metabolism, oxygen is consumed and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced. If not effectively dissipated, ROS can accumulate and damage resident proteins, lipids, and DNA. Enzymes involved in redox regulation and DNA repair dissipate ROS and repair the resulting damage in order to preserve a functional cellular environment. Because increased ROS accumulation and/or unrepaired DNA damage can lead to initiation and progression of cancer and we had identified a number of oxidative stress and DNA repair proteins that influence estrogen responsiveness of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, it seemed possible that these proteins might be differentially expressed in normal mammary tissue, benign hyperplasia (BH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer (IBC).

Methods
Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of a number of oxidative stress proteins, DNA repair proteins, and damage markers in 60 human mammary tissues which were classified as BH, DCIS or IBC. The relative mean intensity was determined for each tissue section and ANOVA was used to detect statistical differences in the relative expression of BH, DCIS and IBC compared to normal mammary tissue.

Results
We found that a number of these proteins were overexpressed and that the cellular localization was altered in human breast cancer tissue.

Conclusions
Our studies suggest that oxidative stress and DNA repair proteins not only protect normal cells from the damaging effects of ROS, but may also promote survival of mammary tumor cells.},

A fundamental question that applies to all life forms, including growth-arrested bacteria, is why growing older by necessity causes organisms to grow more fragile. In this work, we demonstrate that the levels of oxidized proteins is correlated to the age of a stationary-phase Escherichia coli culture; both disulfide bridge formation of a cytoplasmic leader-less alkaline phosphatase and protein carbonyl levels increase during stasis. The stasis-induced increase in protein oxidation is enhanced in cells lacking the global regulators OxyR and ςs. Some proteins were found to be specifically susceptible to stasis-induced oxidation; notably several TCA cycle enzymes, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, pyruvate kinase, DnaK, and H-NS. Evidence that oxidation of target proteins during stasis serves as the signal for stationary-phase, developmental, induction of the heat shock regulon is presented by demonstrating that this induction is mitigated by overproducing the superoxide dismutase SodA. In addition, cells lacking cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase activity exhibit superinduction of heat shock proteins. The possibility that oxidative sensitivity of TCA cycle enzymes serves as a feedback mechanism down-regulating toxic respiration is discussed.},

The analysis of such cells has been hampered by difficulties in studying bacterial population heterogeneity. Using in situ detection of protein oxidation in single E. coli cells, and using a density-gradient centrifugation technique to separate culturable and non-culturable cells, we show that the proteins in non-culturable cells show increased and irreversible oxidative damage, which affects various bacterial compartments and proteins. The levels of expression of specific stress regulons are higher in non-culturable cells, confirming increased defects relating to oxidative damage and the occurrence of aberrant, such as by amino-acid misincorporation, proteins. Our data suggest that non-culturable cells are produced due to stochastic deterioration, rather than an adaptive programme, and pinpoint oxidation management as the 'Achilles heel' of these cells.},

	abstract = {The clinical use of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) is highly limited by its nephrotoxicity. The precise mechanisms involved in cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in kidney have not been completely clarified. Therefore, we investigated in vivo the effects of cisplatin on mitochondrial bioenergetics, redox state, and oxidative stress as well as the occurrence of cell death by apoptosis in cisplatin-treated rat kidney. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 200–220 g were divided into two groups. The control group (n = 8) was treated only with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline solution (1 ml per 100 g body weight), and the cisplatin group (n = 8) was given a single injection of cisplatin (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.). Animals were sacrificed 72 h after the treatment. The cisplatin group presented acute renal failure characterized by increased plasmatic creatinine and urea levels. Mitochondrial dysfunction was evidenced by the decline in membrane electrochemical potential and the substantial decrease in mitochondrial calcium uptake. The mitochondrial antioxidant defense system was depleted, as shown by decreased GSH and NADPH levels, GSH/GSSG ratio, and increased GSSG level. Moreover, cisplatin induced oxidative damage to mitochondrial lipids, including cardiolipin, and oxidation of mitocondrial proteins, as demonstrated by the significant decrease of sulfhydryl protein concentrations and increased levels of carbonylated proteins. Additionally, aconitase activity, which is essential for mitochondrial function, was also found to be lower in the cisplatin group. Renal cell death via apoptosis was evidenced by the increased caspase-3 activity. Results show the central role of mitochondria and the intensification of apoptosis in cisplatin-induced acute renal failure, highlighting a number of steps that might be targeted to minimize cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.},

In this study we investigated whether protein carbonyls (PCOs) also accumulate in the spinal cord of Lewis rats with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Western blots analysis after derivatization with dinitrophenyl hydrazine (oxyblot) showed elevated protein carbonylation at the time of maximal clinical disability. During the same period glutathione levels were substantially reduced, suggesting a causal relationship between these two markers. In contrast, lipid peroxidation products accumulated in EAE spinal cord well before the appearance of neurological symptoms. Carbonyl staining was not restricted to inflammatory lesions but present throughout the spinal cord particularly in neuronal cell bodies and axons. By 2-dimensional-oxyblot we identified several cytoskeletal proteins, including β-actin, GFAP and the neurofilament proteins as the major targets of carbonylation. These findings were confirmed by pull-down experiments, which also showed an increase in the number of carbonylated β-actin molecules and a decrease in that of oxidized neurofilament proteins in EAE. These data suggest the possibility that oxidation targets neurofilament proteins for degradation, which may contribute to axonal pathology observed in MS and EAE.},

	abstract = {Cisplatin is a potent and widely used chemotherapeutic agent. Nephrotoxicity induced by this drug has been well documented. However, very little information is available on cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. High doses of cisplatin have been known to produce hepatotoxicity. Additionally, elevated expression of CYP 2E1 has been associated with enhanced cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. Several studies suggest that cisplatin toxicity occurs by the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. Therefore, the present study examined, in vivo, the cisplatin-induced effects on hepatic mitochondrial structure and function as well as the occurrence of hepatocellular death by apoptosis. Adult male Wistar rats (200–220 g) were divided into two groups (n = 8) treated as follows: (1) control group (saline solution, 1 ml 100 g−1 body weight, i.p.) and (2) cisplatin group (10 mg kg−1 body weight, i.p.). The animals were killed 72 h after the treatment. Hepatotoxicity was evidenced in the cisplatin group by the increased serum levels of alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotransferases. The mechanism of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity was found to involve membrane rigidification; decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, ATP, GSH and NADPH levels; lipid peroxidation; oxidative damage of cardiolipin and protein sulfhydryl groups. Moreover, cell death by apoptosis was also demonstrated and the findings strongly suggest the participation of the mitochondrial signaling pathway in this process. Therefore, the results show the key role of mitochondria in the hepatotoxicity induced by cisplatin and delineate several mitochondrial processes that could be targeted in future cytoprotective therapy approaches.

	abstract = {In brain mitochondria, state 4 respiration supported by the NAD-linked substrates glutamate/malate in the presence of EGTA promotes a high rate of exogenous H2O2 removal. Omitting EGTA decreases the H2O2 removal rate by almost 80\%. The decrease depends on the influx of contaminating Ca2+, being prevented by the Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor ruthenium red. Arsenite is also an inhibitor (maximal effect approximately 40\%, IC50, 12 microm). The H2O2 removal rate (EGTA present) is decreased by 20\% during state 3 respiration and by 60-70\% in fully uncoupled conditions. H2O2 removal in mitochondria is largely dependent on glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Both enzyme activities, as studied in disrupted mitochondria, are inhibited by Ca2+. Glutathione reductase is decreased by 70\% with an IC50 of about 0.9 microm, and glutathione peroxidase is decreased by 38\% with a similar IC50. The highest Ca2+ effect with glutathione reductase is observed in the presence of low concentrations of H2O2. With succinate as substrate, the removal is 50\% less than with glutamate/malate. This appears to depend on succinate-supported production of H2O2 by reverse electron flow at NADH dehydrogenase competing with exogenous H2O2 for removal. Succinate-dependent H2O2 is inhibited by rotenone, decreased DeltaPsi, as described previously, and by ruthenium red and glutamate/malate. These agents also increase the measured rate of exogenous H2O2 removal with succinate. Succinate-dependent H2O2 generation is also inhibited by contaminating Ca2+. Therefore, Ca2+ acts as an inhibitor of both H2O2 removal and the succinate-supported H2O2 production. It is concluded that mitochondria function as intracellular Ca2+-modulated peroxide sinks.},

Autophagic delivery to lysosomes is the major degradative pathway in mitochondrial turnover, and we use the term mitophagy to refer to mitochondrial degradation by autophagy. Although long assumed to be a random process, increasing evidence indicates that mitophagy is a selective process.

Further, oxidants regulate numerous cell signaling pathways and modulate the expression of many genes. This oxidant-mediated change in gene expression involves changes at transcriptional, mRNA stability, and signal transduction levels. Furthermore, numerous products associated with oxidant-modulated genes have been identified and include antioxidant enzymes, stress proteins, and mitochondrial electron transport proteins. Interestingly, low and physiological levels of reactive oxygen species are required for normal force production in skeletal muscle, but high levels of reactive oxygen species result in contractile dysfunction and fatigue.

The proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB has been implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and regulation of transepithelial sodium transport. The effect of aldosterone on the NF-κB pathway in principal cells of the cortical collecting duct, a major physiologic target of aldosterone, is unknown. Here, in both cultured cells and freshly isolated rat cortical collecting duct, aldosterone activated the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to increased expression of several NF-κB–targeted genes (IκBα, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL-1β, and IL-6). Small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1, a gene induced early in the response to aldosterone, but not pharmacologic inhibition of extracellular signal–regulated kinase and p38 kinase, attenuated aldosterone-induced NF-κB activation. Pharmacologic antagonism or knockdown of the mineralocorticoid receptor prevented aldosterone-induced NF-κB activity. In addition, activation of the glucocorticoid receptor inhibited the transactivation of NF-κB by aldosterone. In agreement with these in vitro findings, spironolactone prevented NF-κB–induced transcriptional activation observed in cortical collecting ducts of salt-restricted rats. In summary, aldosterone activates the canonical NF-κB pathway in principal cells of the cortical collecting duct by activating the mineralocorticoid receptor and by inducing SGK1.},

SOCE and agonist-induced [Ca2+]i increase are significantly blunted in platelets from SGK1 knockout mice (sgk1−/−). Similarly, Ca2+-dependent degranulation, integrin αIIbβ3 activation, phosphatidylserine exposure, aggregation, and in vitro thrombus formation were significantly impaired in sgk1−/− platelets, whereas tail bleeding time was not significantly enhanced. Platelet and megakaryocyte Orai1 transcript levels and membrane protein abundance were significantly reduced in sgk1−/− mice. In human megakaryoblastic cells (MEG-01), transfection with constitutively active S422DSGK1 but not with inactive K127NSGK1 significantly enhanced Orai1 expression and SOCE, while effects reversed by the SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394 (1μM).

	abstract = {The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a live-cell system is routinely measured using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein (DCF). However, it is difficult to simultaneously monitor cellular oxidative responses and ROS generation in cells, and analyses of cellular oxidative responses are typically performed after ROS generation has been evaluated. In this study, we developed a modified fixed staining method that allows the simultaneous analysis of ROS generation and oxidative responses using standard immunostaining techniques. A microplate reader-based assay showed that of the fixatives tested, only methanol did not alter the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidation of the responsive dye 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA), a chloromethyl derivative of H2DCFDA, or the fluorescence of oxidized DCF in vitro. Further in vivo assays using flow cytometry showed that both methanol and acetic acid maintained the fluorescence of oxidized DCF in H2O2-, antimycin A-, and serum starvation-treated human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells. Following acetic acid-based fixation, the ROS generation in starved HMEC-1 cells could be evaluated by flow cytometric analysis while simultaneously monitoring the phosphorylation status of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Immunostaining also revealed the synchronization of ROS generation and the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase2. This study describes a modified method that may be used in future biomedical investigations to simultaneously measure intracellular ROS production and cellular oxidative responses.},

The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is activated by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a mediator of skeletal muscle wasting in cachexia. Here, the role of NF-κB in cytokine-induced muscle degeneration was explored. In differentiating C2C12 myocytes, TNF-induced activation of NF-κB inhibited SMD by suppressing MyoD mRNA at the posttranscriptional level. In contrast, in differentiated myotubes, TNF plus interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling was required for NF-κB–dependent down-regulation of MyoD and dysfunction of skeletal myofibers. MyoD mRNA was also down-regulated by TNF and IFN-γ expression in mouse muscle in vivo. These data elucidate a possible mechanism that may underlie the skeletal muscle decay in cachexia.},

	abstract = {Loss of skeletal muscle mass occurs during aging (sarcopenia), disease (cachexia), or inactivity (atrophy). This article contrasts and compares the metabolic causes of loss of muscle resulting from these conditions. An understanding of the underlying causes of muscle loss is critical for the development of strategies and therapies to preserve muscle mass and function. Loss of skeletal muscle protein results from an imbalance between the rate of muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Cachexia, sarcopenia, and atrophy due to inactivity are characterized by a loss of muscle mass. Each of these conditions results in a metabolic adaptation of increased protein degradation (cachexia), decreased rate of muscle protein synthesis (inactivity), or an alteration in both (sarcopenia). The clinical consequences of bedrest may mimic those of cachexia, including rapid loss of muscle, insulin resistance, and weakness. Prophylaxis against bedrest-induced atrophy includes nutrition support with an emphasis on high-quality protein. Nutritional supplementation alone may not prevent muscle loss secondary to cachexia, but, in combination with the use of an anabolic agent, it may slow or prevent muscle loss.},

FoxO proteins are regulated by multiple mechanisms. They undergo inhibitory phosphorylation by protein kinases such as Akt, SGK, IKK and CDK2 in response to external and internal stimuli. By contrast, they are activated by upstream regulators such as JNK and MST1 under stress conditions. Their activities are counterbalanced by the acetylases CBP and p300 and the deacetylase SIRT1. Also, whereas polyubiquitylation of FoxO1 and FoxO3a leads to their degradation by the proteasome, monoubiquitylation of FoxO4 facilitates its nuclear localization and augments its transcriptional activity. Thus, the potent functions of FoxO proteins are tightly controlled by complex signaling pathways under physiological conditions; dysregulation of these proteins may ultimately lead to disease such as cancer.},

	abstract = {Alteration of skeletal muscle protein breakdown is a hallmark of a set of pathologies, including sepsis, with negative consequences for recovery. The aim of the present study was to search for muscle markers associated with protein loss, which could help in predicting and understanding pathological wasting. With the use of differential display reverse transcription-PCR, we screened differentially expressed genes in muscle from septic rats in a long-lasting catabolic state. One clone was isolated, confirmed as being overexpressed in septic skeletal muscle and identified as encoding the lysosomal cysteine endopeptidase cathepsin L. Northern- and Western-blot analysis of cathepsin L in gastrocnemius or tibialis anterior muscles of septic rats confirmed an elevation (up to 3-fold) of both mRNA and protein levels as early as 2 days post-infection, and a further increase 6 days post-infection (up to 13-fold). At the same time, the increase in mRNAs encoding other lysosomal endopeptidases or components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway did not exceed 4-fold. Cathepsin L mRNA was also increased in tibialis anterior muscle of rats treated with the glucocorticoid analogue, dexamethasone, or rats bearing the Yoshida Sarcoma. The increase in cathepsin L mRNA was reduced by 40\% when the tumour-bearing animals were treated with pentoxifylline, an inhibitor of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production. In conclusion, these results demonstrate a positive and direct correlation between cathepsin L mRNA and protein level and the intensity of proteolysis, and identify cathepsin L as an appropriate early marker of muscle wasting. Cathepsin L presumably participates in the pathological response leading to muscle loss, with glucocorticoids and tumour necrosis factor-alpha potentially being involved in the up-regulation of cathepsin L.},

	abstract = {Prolonged fasting alters skeletal muscle gene expression in a manner that promotes myofiber atrophy, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we examined the potential role of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcription factor with an evolutionarily ancient role in the cellular response to starvation. In mouse skeletal muscle, fasting increases the level of ATF4 mRNA. To determine whether increased ATF4 expression was required for myofiber atrophy, we reduced ATF4 expression with an inhibitory RNA targeting ATF4 and found that it reduced myofiber atrophy during fasting. Likewise, reducing the fasting level of ATF4 mRNA with a phosphorylation-resistant form of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α decreased myofiber atrophy. To determine whether ATF4 was sufficient to reduce myofiber size, we overexpressed ATF4 and found that it reduced myofiber size in the absence of fasting. In contrast, a transcriptionally inactive ATF4 construct did not reduce myofiber size, suggesting a requirement for ATF4-mediated transcriptional regulation. To begin to determine the mechanism of ATF4-mediated myofiber atrophy, we compared the effects of fasting and ATF4 overexpression on global skeletal muscle mRNA expression. Interestingly, expression of ATF4 increased a small subset of five fasting-responsive mRNAs, including four of the 15 mRNAs most highly induced by fasting. These five mRNAs encode proteins previously implicated in growth suppression (p21Cip1/Waf1, GADD45α, and PW1/Peg3) or titin-based stress signaling [muscle LIM protein (MLP) and cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP)]. Taken together, these data identify ATF4 as a novel mediator of skeletal myofiber atrophy during starvation. ,  Fasting induces ATF4 expression in skeletal muscle, which in turn promotes myofiber atrophy. , AffiliationsDepartment of Internal Medicine (C.M.A.), Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Iowa City, Iowa 52246; and Department of Internal Medicine (S.M.E., A.M., D.K.F., K.S.B., B.E.S., S.E.M., B.L.D., M.S., C.M.A.), Roy J. and Lucille A.

	abstract = {Diverse stresses including starvation and muscle disuse cause skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms of muscle atrophy are complex and not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45a protein (Gadd45a) is a critical mediator of muscle atrophy. We identified Gadd45a through an unbiased search for potential downstream mediators of the stress-inducible, pro-atrophy transcription factor ATF4. We show that Gadd45a is required for skeletal muscle atrophy induced by three distinct skeletal muscle stresses: fasting, muscle immobilization, and muscle denervation. Conversely, forced expression of Gadd45a in muscle or cultured myotubes induces atrophy in the absence of upstream stress. We show that muscle-specific ATF4 knock-out mice have a reduced capacity to induce Gadd45a mRNA in response to stress, and as a result, they undergo less atrophy in response to fasting or muscle immobilization. Interestingly, Gadd45a is a myonuclear protein that induces myonuclear remodeling and a comprehensive program for muscle atrophy. Gadd45a represses genes involved in anabolic signaling and energy production, and it induces pro-atrophy genes. As a result, Gadd45a reduces multiple barriers to muscle atrophy (including PGC-1α, Akt activity, and protein synthesis) and stimulates pro-atrophy mechanisms (including autophagy and caspase-mediated proteolysis). These results elucidate a critical stress-induced pathway that reprograms muscle gene expression to cause atrophy.},

Apart from their role in cell death, BNIP3 and NIX are also implicated in the induction of autophagy. In erythroid cells, NIX is required for a specialized type of autophagy that targets mitochondria for elimination (mitophagy). Similarly, BNIP3 regulates mitophagy in response to hypoxia.

YXM110 is a newly synthesized phenanthroquinolizidines that exhibits excellent anticancer activity in numerous cancer cells. In this study, we examined the anticancer mechanisms of YXM110 both in vitro and in vivo. Protein level of 4E-binding protein 1, which is crucial in cap-independent translation, was decreased significantly after YXM110 treatment via c-Jun N-terminal kinases-mediated proteasomal degradation. Moreover, the effects of YXM110 were associated with several characteristics of autophagy, including accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, elevation of Atg12-Atg5 and light chain 3 (LC3)-II, and levels of GFP-LC3 puncta. The results suggested that depletion of Mcl-1 contributes to YXM110-triggered autophagy, whereas downregulation of lysosomal-related genes could cause autophagy impairment. Furthermore, YXM110-induced cell death was prevented by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and Atg5 silencing, indicating that YXM110-mediated autophagy impairment leads to cancer cell death. These data reveal key mechanisms that support the further development of YXM110 as a promising anticancer agent.},

In contrast, the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 is bound to, and inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. This interaction can be disrupted by phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1, or ubiquitination of Beclin 1. Interestingly, caspase-mediated cleavage of Beclin 1 promotes crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy.

In a small proportion of soleus muscle fibers the organization and development of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is similar to that of EDL muscle fibers, with prominent fenestrated collars at the H band level. In these fibers mitochondria are larger and more abundant. The results are correlated with physiological studies on motor units in the same and in similar rat muscles.

	abstract = {A significant amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated during mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Several studies have suggested that mtDNA may accumulate more oxidative DNA damage relative to nuclear DNA. This study used quantitative PCR to examine the formation and repair of hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in a 16.2-kb mitochondrial fragment and a 17.7-kb fragment flanking the beta-globin gene. Simian virus 40-transformed fibroblasts treated with 200 microM hydrogen peroxide for 15 or 60 min exhibited 3-fold more damage to the mitochondrial genome compared with the nuclear fragment. Following a 60-min treatment, damage to the nuclear fragment was completely repaired within 1.5 hr, whereas no DNA repair in the mitochondrion was observed. Mitochondrial function, as assayed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide reduction, also showed a sharp decline. These cells displayed arrested-cell growth, large increases in p21 protein levels, and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. In contrast, when hydrogen peroxide treatments were limited to 15 min, mtDNA damage was repaired with similar kinetics as the nuclear fragment, mitochondrial function was restored, and cells resumed division within 12 hr. These results indicate that mtDNA is a critical cellular target for ROS. A model is presented in which chronic ROS exposure, found in several degenerative diseases associated with aging, leads to decreased mitochondrial function, increased mitochondrial-generated ROS, and persistent mitochondrial DNA damage. Thus persistent mitochondrial DNA damage may serve as a useful biomarker for ROS-associated diseases.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Cu/Zn SOD on reduction of hindlimb muscular atrophy induced by cisplatin in rats.
METHODS: Forty-two rats were assigned to three groups; control group, Cisplatin (CDDP) group and cisplatin with Cu/Zn SOD (CDDP-SOD) group. At day 35 hindlimb muscles were dissected. Food intake, activity, withdrawal threshold, muscle weight, and Type I, II fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) of dissected muscles were measured. Relative SOD activity and expression of MHC and phosphorylated Akt, ERK were measured after dissection.
RESULTS: Muscle weight and Type I, II fiber CSA of hindlimb muscles in the CDDP group were significantly less than the control group. Muscle weight and Type I, II fiber CSA of hindlimb muscles, food intake, activity, and withdrawal thresholds of the CDDP-SOD group were significantly greater than the CDDP group. There were no significant differences in relative SOD activities of hindlimb muscles between the CDDP-SOD and CDDP groups. MHC expression and phosphorylated Akt, ERK of hindlimb muscles in the CDDP-SOD group were significantly greater than the CDDP group.
CONCLUSION: Cu/Zn SOD attenuates hindlimb muscular atrophy induced by cisplatin through increased food intake and activity. Increment of phosphorylated Akt, ERK may relate to attenuation of hindlimb muscular atrophy.},

	abstract = {Definitive data on mineral bioavailability in humans and animals can be obtained by using isotopic tracers. The use of stable isotope tracers to study important issues in mineral nutrition has expanded rapidly in the past two decades, particularly in human nutrition studies. Stable isotopes have a number of advantages over radioisotopes. There is no exposure to radiation with stable isotopes, and some minerals have no radioisotope that can be used satisfactorily as a tracer. Multiple stable isotopes of one mineral and isotopes of multiple minerals can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. The analytical methods of choice for stable isotopes are thermal ionization mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). Thermal ionization mass spectrometry offers the greatest precision and accuracy, but it is slower, more labor intensive, and more costly than ICPMS. Bioavailability data are critical to establishing reliable dietary mineral requirements and recommendations. Combined with a computer program for compartmental modeling, mineral kinetics can be studied, including mineral turnover, pool sizes, and transfer rates between compartments. Our laboratory conducts studies using stable isotopes of Zn, Cu, Fe, Ca, Mg, and Mo. We have studied the effect of the amount of dietary intake of minerals on bioavailability and use, pregnancy and aging, and interactions among minerals. The research resulted in establishing new dietary recommendations for Cu and Mo and developing compartmental models for these minerals. Although stable isotopes have been used more extensively to date in humans than in animals, the techniques applied to humans can be used to study a number of issues important to optimizing feeding strategies for animal production.},

Continual improvements in LC/MS interface technologies combined with powerful features for structure analysis, qualitative and quantitative, have resulted in a widened scope of application. These improvements coincided with breakthroughs in combinatorial chemistry, molecular biology, and an overall industry trend of accelerated development. New technologies have created a situation where the rate of sample generation far exceeds the rate of sample analysis. As a result, new paradigms for the analysis of drugs and related substances have been developed. The growth in LC/MS applications has been extensive, with retention time and molecular weight emerging as essential analytical features from drug target to product. LC/MS-based methodologies that involve automation, predictive or surrogate models, and open access systems have become a permanent fixture in the drug development landscape. An iterative cycle of "what is it?" and "how much is there?" continues to fuel the tremendous growth of LC/MS in the pharmaceutical industry. During this time, LC/MS has become widely accepted as an integral part of the drug development process. This review describes the utility of LC/MS techniques for accelerated drug development and provides a perspective on the significant changes in strategies for pharmaceutical analysis.

	abstract = {Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has seen enormous growth in clinical laboratories during the last 10–15 years. It offers analytical specificity superior to that of immunoassays or conventional high performance/pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for low molecular weight analytes and has higher throughput than gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Drug/Toxicology and Biochemical Genetics/Newborn Screening laboratories were at the vanguard of clinical LC-MS/MS use, but have been eclipsed by Endocrine laboratories. In USA reference/referral laboratories, most steroids and biogenic amines are now assayed by LC-MS/MS, and the technology has started to penetrate into smaller laboratories. Assays for mineralo- and gluco-corticoids and their precursors, sex steroids, metanephrines and 25-hydroxy vitamin D highlight the advantages of LC-MS/MS., However, several limitations of LC-MS/MS have become apparent, centring on the interacting triangle of sensitivity – specificity – throughput. While sample throughput is higher than for conventional HPLC or GC-MS, it lags behind automated immunoassays. Techniques which improve throughput include direct sample injection, LC-multiplexing and samplemultiplexing. Measures to improve specificity and sensitivity include sample clean-up and optimising chromatography to avoid interferences and ion suppression due to sample-matrix components. Next generation instrumentation may offer additional benefits., The next challenge for clinical LC-MS/MS is peptide/protein analysis. The quest for multi-biomarker profiles for various diseases has largely failed, but targeted peptide and protein testing by LC-MS/MS, directed at analytical and clinical questions that need to be answered, is proving highly successful. We anticipate that this will result in similar growth of clinical protein/peptide LC-MS/MS as has been seen for low molecular weight applications.},

	abstract = {During the development of a new drug compound, its metabolism needs to be unraveled. For quantification of the metabolites formed, the drug under investigation is traditionally synthesized with a radiolabel (14C or 3H) and the metabolites present in different matrixes (blood, urine, feces) upon drug administration are determined by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to radiodetection. This approach allows for quantification of the metabolites formed and enables a straightforward distinction between exogenous (i.e., drug-related) and endogenous species (as only the radiolabeled species are detected). However, in some cases, the use of a radiolabeled compound in human in vivo studies is not advisible, e.g., for drug compounds or their metabolites showing a long plasma or tissue half-life. In cases where the candidate drug molecule contains an element detectable by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), HPLC/ICP-MS is a promising alternative approach. However, the method lacks specificity when a distinction between drug-related species and endogenous compounds containing the same target element needs to be accomplished. As a result, we have developed an HPLC/ICP-MS-based method combined with ?reverse? online isotope dilution (?reverse? online ID) for metabolite quantification. The methodology was evaluated by the analysis of feces samples from rats dosed with a 81Br-labeled drug compound. The method allows for both (i) valid quantification of the drug metabolites and (ii) distinction among endogenous, exogenous, and ?mixed? species, based on their isotopic ?fingerprint?. A good repeatability (relative standard deviation of 4.2\%) and limit of detection (0.35 mg of drug compound L?1 of feces extract), of the same order of magnitude as those observed for ?normal? online ID HPLC/ICP-MS and HPLC/radiodetection, were achieved.},

	abstract = {In an effort to overcome the limitations of balloon-expandible intravascular metal stent-induced neointimal formation, drug-coated stent devices have been developed. The stent platform allows the local delivery of drugs to an injury site, thereby reducing the amount of drug exposure to the systemic circulation and other organs. The drug carrier matrix allows the release of the drug in a diffusion-controlled manner over an extended time period after the stent implant. The drugs are chosen such that the complex cascade of events that occurs after stent implantation that leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration towards the intima are inhibited. The success of an antirestenotic drug therapy from a drug-coated stent is dependent, at least partially, on the extent of drug elution from the stent, the duration and rate of release, and accumulation of drug in the arterial wall in such a way that it covers the initiation and progression of vessel wall remodeling. The local vascular drug concentrations achieved are directly correlated with the biological effects and local vascular toxicity, and there is therefore a challenge in finding an optimum dose of drug to be delivered to tissues (ie, one that has the desired therapeutic effect without local adverse effects). There is increased focus on optimization of various factors that affect drug release from the stent system, including the physicochemical properties of the drugs, carrier vehicle formulation, and profile of elution kinetics. This review highlights the various factors involved in drug release kinetics, local vascular toxicity, carrier vehicle matrix, tissue deposition, and distribution through the arterial wall from stent-based drug delivery systems.},

A major disadvantage is the high capital cost of the instrumentation. Heavier elements, such as lead, are well-suited for ICP-MS analysis, whereas lighter elements are prone to more interferences. Lighter elements which are not amenable to assay by ICP-MS include chromium and iron. The ability to measure isotopes is a major advantage for mass spectrometry methods and has the potential to expand the usefulness of trace element analysis.},

	abstract = {An analysis method of microwave digestion and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with octopole reaction system (ORS) was established for the determination of 10 heavy metal elements including Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hg and Pb in sweetener. Samples were decomposed by HNO3 and H2O2 followed by dilution with ultrapure water then the above 10 heavy metal elements in the solution were analyzed directly by ICP-MS. The use of ORS can eliminate the interference of polyatomic ions dramatically. 45Sc, 89Y, 115In and 209Bi as internal standard elements were used to compensate matrix effect and signal drift. The optimum conditions for the determination was tested and discussed. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limits of the 10 elements were in the range of 0.003-0.038 MICROg x L(-1), the recovery of the samples was in the range of 93.0\%-106.6\% and the relative standard deviation (RSD) {\textless} or = 3.4\%, which showed that the method was very precise. The technique was applied for the quality control and safety evaluation of sweetener.},

Felodipine (Felo) dispersed in PVP matrix (solid dispersion) was used as a model drug in this study. Drug/polymer ratios have an impact on the drug average particle size, morphology and dissolution profile while solid dispersions containing up to 50wt\% Felo are completely amorphous. SEM, TEM micrographs, and micro-Raman mapping reveal that Felo is dispersed in the form of nanoparticles into the PVP matrix. Due to the high spatial resolution of TEM, it was established that these nanoparticles are not uniform particles, but rather agglomerates of individual particles with sizes smaller than 5-10nm. Moreover, micro-Raman mapping allowed us to observe the size and spatial distribution of domains where the drug existed as molecularly or nanodispersed. Experimental evidence presented in this work contradicts the common belief that amorphous poorly water-soluble drugs exist only in the state of molecular dispersion inside a polymer matrix by showing that both types of dispersions (molecular-level and nanodispersions) can coexist.},

	abstract = {Materials that simultaneously mimic soft tissue in vivo for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) for use in a prostate phantom have been developed. Prostate and muscle mimicking materials contain water, agarose, lipid particles, protein, Cu++, EDTA, glass beads, and thimerosal (preservative). Fat was mimicked with safflower oil suffusing a random mesh (network) of polyurethane. Phantom material properties were measured at 22 degrees C. (22 degrees C is a typical room temperature at which phantoms are used.) The values of material properties should match, as well as possible, the values for tissues at body temperature, 37 degrees C. For MRI, the primary properties of interest are T1 and T2 relaxations times, for US they are the attenuation coefficient, propagation speed, and backscatter, and for CT, the x-ray attenuation. Considering the large number of parameters to be mimicked, rather good agreement was found with actual tissue values obtained from the literature. Using published values for prostate parenchyma, T1 and T2 at 37 degrees C and 40 MHz are estimated to be about 1,100 and 98 ms, respectively. The CT number for in vivo prostate is estimated to be 45 HU (Hounsfield units). The prostate mimicking material has a T1 of 937 ms and a T2 of 88 ms at 22 degrees C and 40 MHz; the propagation speed and attenuation coefficient slope are 1,540 m/s and 0.36 dB/cm/MHz, respectively, and the CT number of tissue mimicking prostate is 43 HU. Tissue mimicking (TM) muscle differs from TM prostate in the amount of dry weight agarose, Cu++, EDTA, and the quality and quantity of glass beads. The 18 microm glass beads used in TM muscle increase US backscatter and US attenuation; the presence of the beads also has some effect on T1 but no effect on T2. The composition of tissue-mimicking materials developed is such that different versions can be placed in direct contact with one another in a phantom with no long term change in US, MRI, or CT properties. Thus, anthropomorphic phantoms can be constructed.},

	abstract = {Forkhead transcription factors of the FOXO class are negatively regulated by PKB/c-Akt in response to insulin/IGF signalling, and are involved in regulating cell cycle progression and cell death. Here we show that, in contrast to insulin signalling, low levels of oxidative stress generated by treatment with H2O2 induce the activation of FOXO4. Upon treatment of cells with H2O2, the small GTPase Ral is activated and this results in a JNK-dependent phosphorylation of FOXO4 on threonine 447 and threonine 451. This Ral-mediated, JNK-dependent phosphorylation is involved in the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of FOXO4 after H2O2 treatment. In addition, we show that this signalling pathway is also employed by tumor necrosis factor α to activate FOXO4 transcriptional activity. FOXO members have been implicated in cellular protection against oxidative stress via the transcriptional regulation of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase gene expression. The results reported here, therefore, outline a homeostasis mechanism for sustaining cellular reactive oxygen species that is controlled by signalling pathways that can convey both negative (PI-3K/PKB) and positive (Ras/Ral) inputs.},

We argue that shifting the balance between actin protrusion, actomyosin contraction, and adhesion to the extracellular substrate can explain the different modes of amoeboid movement and that blebbing and gliding are barely extreme variants of one common migration strategy. Depending on the cell type, physiological conditions or experimental manipulation, amoeboid cells can adopt the distinct mechanical modes of amoeboid migration.},

Although recent studies have implicated polarized activation of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase in G protein-mediated chemotaxis, the role of 3′ PI lipids in tyrosine kinase-triggered chemotaxis is not well understood. Using evanescent wave microscopy and green fluorescent protein–tagged Akt pleckstrin homology domain (GFP–AktPH) as a molecular sensor, we show that application of a shallow PDGF gradient triggers a markedly steeper gradient in 3′ PI lipids in the adhesion zone of fibroblasts. Polar GFP–AktPH gradients, as well as a new type of radial gradient, were measured from front to rear and from the periphery to the center of the adhesion zone, respectively. A strong spatial correlation between polarized 3′ PI production and rapid membrane spreading implicates 3′ PI lipids as a direct mediator of polarized migration. Analysis of the temporal changes of 3′ PI gradients in the adhesion zone revealed a fast diffusion coefficient (0.5 μm2/s) and short lifetime of 3′ PIs of {\textless}1 min. Together, this study suggests that the tyrosine kinase-coupled directional movement of fibroblasts and their radial membrane activity are controlled by local generation and rapid degradation of 3′ PI second messengers.},

Interference with β1-integrin function induced complex changes in cluster polarity and cohesion, including development of two or several opposing leading edges, cluster disruption, and the detachment of individual cells followed by β1-integrin-independent “amoeboid” crawling and dissemination.

	abstract = {Myostatin is a member of the TGF-β superfamily that is essential for proper regulation of skeletal muscle growth. As do other TGF-β superfamily members, myostatin signals into the cell via a receptor complex that consists of two distinct transmembrane proteins, known as the type I and type II receptors. Vertebrates have seven distinct type I receptors, each of which can mix and match with one of five type I receptors to mediate signals for all the TGF-β family ligands. Accumulating evidence indicates that myostatin shares its pair of receptors with activin, and therefore, the question arises about how specificity in signaling is achieved. Our hypothesis is that a mechanism has to exist to restrict myostatin actions to the muscle cells. To investigate this possibility, we compared the effect of endogenous myostatin (myostatin overexpressed by myoblasts) and exogenous myostatin (recombinant myostatin added to the culture medium) in cultured myoblasts. As opposed to exogenous myostatin, endogenous myostatin induced the transcription of a reporter vector in cultured myoblasts. Notably, the myostatin concentrations that failed to induce a response in myoblasts were effective in MCF-7 cells (human mammary carcinoma) and in HepG2 cells (human hepatic carcinoma). Based on our observations, we propose that a mechanism exists that differentially regulates the bioavailability of endogenous and exogenous myostatin to muscle cells. This is consistent with a model in which myostatin actions are exerted in vivo in an autocrine fashion.},

	abstract = {Sarcolemma-associated neuronal NOS (nNOS) plays a critical role in normal muscle physiology. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the loss of sarcolemmal nNOS leads to functional ischemia and muscle damage; however, the mechanism of nNOS subcellular localization remains incompletely understood. According to the prevailing model, nNOS is recruited to the sarcolemma by syntrophin, and in DMD this localization is altered. Intriguingly, the presence of syntrophin on the membrane does not always restore sarcolemmal nNOS. Thus, we wished to determine whether dystrophin functions in subcellular localization of nNOS and which regions may be necessary. Using in vivo transfection of dystrophin deletion constructs, we show that sarcolemmal targeting of nNOS was dependent on the spectrin-like repeats 16 and 17 (R16/17) within the rod domain. Treatment of mdx mice (a DMD model) with R16/17-containing synthetic dystrophin genes effectively ameliorated histological muscle pathology and improved muscle strength as well as exercise performance. Furthermore, sarcolemma-targeted nNOS attenuated α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in contracting muscle and improved muscle perfusion during exercise as measured by Doppler and microsphere circulation. In summary, we have identified the dystrophin spectrin-like repeats 16 and 17 as a novel scaffold for nNOS sarcolemmal targeting. These data suggest that muscular dystrophy gene therapies based on R16/17-containing dystrophins may yield better clinical outcomes than the current therapies.},

Induction of collagen crosslinking stiffened the ECM, promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3 kinase (PI3K) activity, and induced the invasion of an oncogene-initiated epithelium. Inhibition of integrin signaling repressed the invasion of a premalignant epithelium into a stiffened, crosslinked ECM and forced integrin clustering promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3K signaling, and induced the invasion of a premalignant epithelium. Consistently, reduction of lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking prevented MMTV-Neu-induced fibrosis, decreased focal adhesions and PI3K activity, impeded malignancy, and lowered tumor incidence.

Recent biosensor studies have shown that all three GTPases are activated at the front of migrating cells, and biochemical evidence suggests that they may regulate one another: Cdc42 can activate Rac1 (ref. 8), and Rac1 and RhoA are mutually inhibitory. However, their spatiotemporal coordination, at the seconds and single-micrometre dimensions typical of individual protrusion events, remains unknown. Here we examine GTPase coordination in mouse embryonic fibroblasts both through simultaneous visualization of two GTPase biosensors and using a ‘computational multiplexing’ approach capable of defining the relationships between multiple protein activities visualized in separate experiments. We found that RhoA is activated at the cell edge synchronous with edge advancement, whereas Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated 2 μm behind the edge with a delay of 40 s. This indicates that Rac1 and RhoA operate antagonistically through spatial separation and precise timing, and that RhoA has a role in the initial events of protrusion, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activate pathways implicated in reinforcement and stabilization of newly expanded protrusions.},

We found that depletion of RhoGDI1 promotes misfolding and degradation of the cytosolic geranylgeranylated pool of Rho GTPases while unexpectedly activating the remaining membrane-bound fraction. Since RhoGDI1 levels are limiting, and Rho proteins compete for binding to RhoGDI1, overexpression of an exogenous Rho GTPase displaces endogenous Rho proteins bound to RhoGDI1, inducing their degradation and inactivation. These results raise important questions about the conclusions drawn from studies that manipulate Rho protein levels. In many cases the response observed may arise not simply from the overexpression per se, but from additional effects on the levels and activity of other Rho GTPases due to competition for binding to RhoGDI1, and may require a re-evaluation of previously published studies that rely exclusively on these techniques.},

As a key component of Wnt signaling, Dishevelled (Dvl/Dsh) protein relays Wnt signals from receptors to downstream effectors. In the canonical Wnt pathway that depends on the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, Dvl is recruited by the receptor Frizzled and prevents the constitutive destruction of cytosolic beta-catenin. In the non-canonical Wnt pathways such as Wnt-Frizzled/PCP (planar cell polarity) signaling, Dvl signals via the Daam1-RhoA axis and the Rac1 axis. In addition, Dvl plays important roles in Wnt-GSK3beta-microtubule signaling, Wnt-calcium signaling, Wnt-RYK signaling, Wnt-atypical PKC signaling, etc. Dvl also functions to mediate receptor endocytosis. To fulfill its multifaceted functions, it is not surprising that Dvl associates with various kinds of proteins. Its activity is also modulated dynamically by phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of Dvl functions in Wnt signal transduction and its biological functions in mouse development, and also discuss the molecular mechanisms of its actions.},

Here we describe the development of a calibrated biosensor that measures forces across specific proteins in cells with piconewton (pN) sensitivity, as demonstrated by single molecule fluorescence force spectroscopy. The method is applied to vinculin, a protein that connects integrins to actin filaments and whose recruitment to focal adhesions (FAs) is force-dependent. We show that tension across vinculin in stable FAs is approximately 2.5 pN and that vinculin recruitment to FAs and force transmission across vinculin are regulated separately. Highest tension across vinculin is associated with adhesion assembly and enlargement. Conversely, vinculin is under low force in disassembling or sliding FAs at the trailing edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, vinculin is required for stabilizing adhesions under force. Together, these data reveal that FA stabilization under force requires both vinculin recruitment and force transmission, and that, surprisingly, these processes can be controlled independently.},

A greater force was required to separate cell doublets bound to fibronectin or vitronectin-coated beads than for doublets bound to polylysine-coated beads. This effect depended on cell spreading and the duration of stimulation. Cells expressing type II cadherin-7 also responded to fibronectin stimulation to produce a higher intercellular adhesion. Establishment of cadherin-mediated adhesion needed ROCK, MLCK and myosin ATPase II activity. The regulation of intercellular adhesion strength by integrin stimulation required activation of Src family kinases, ROCK and actomyosin contractility.

	abstract = {From the earliest stages of embryonic development, cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin contribute to the structure and function of developing organs. However, these phenotypes are not always permanent, and instead, under the appropriate conditions, epithelial and mesenchymal cells convert between these two phenotypes. These processes, termed Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), or the reverse Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET), are required for complex body patterning and morphogenesis. In addition, epithelial plasticity and the acquisition of invasive properties without the full commitment to a mesenchymal phenotype are critical in development, particularly during branching morphogenesis in the mammary gland. Recent work in cancer has identified an analogous plasticity of cellular phenotypes whereby epithelial cancer cells acquire mesenchymal features that permit escape from the primary tumor. Because local invasion is thought to be a necessary first step in metastatic dissemination, EMT and epithelial plasticity are hypothesized to contribute to tumor progression. Similarities between developmental and oncogenic EMT have led to the identification of common contributing pathways, suggesting that the reactivation of developmental pathways in breast and other cancers contributes to tumor progression. For example, developmental EMT regulators including Snail/Slug, Twist, Six1, and Cripto, along with developmental signaling pathways including TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin, are misexpressed in breast cancer and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. This review focuses on the parallels between epithelial plasticity/EMT in the mammary gland and other organs during development, and on a selection of developmental EMT regulators that are misexpressed specifically during breast cancer.},

Within 24h of 50 μM cisPt administration, C2C12 myotubes displayed unchanged cell viability but showed a subset of hallmark signs typically recognized during atrophy, including severe reduction in body size, repression of Akt phosphorylation, transcriptional up-regulation of atrophy-related genes, such as atrogin-1, gabarap, beclin-1 and bnip-3, and loss of myogenic markers. As a consequence, proteasomal activity and formation of autophagosomes were remarkably increased in cisPt-treated myotubes, but forced stimulation of Akt pathway, as obtained through insulin administration or delivery of a constitutively activated Akt form, was sufficient to counter the cisPt-induced protein breakdown, leading to rescue of atrophic size. Overall, these results indicate that cisPt induces atrophy of C2C12 myotubes via activation of proteasome and autophagy systems, suggesting that the Akt pathway represents one sensitive target of cisPt molecular action in skeletal muscle.},

Depletion of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) blocks collective cancer-cell invasion in a range of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and 'organotypic' models. DDR1 coordinates the Par3/Par6 cell-polarity complex through its carboxy terminus, binding PDZ domains in Par3 and Par6. The DDR1-Par3/Par6 complex controls the localization of RhoE to cell-cell contacts, where it antagonizes ROCK-driven actomyosin contractility.

Indeed, many of the first-line therapeutic regimens, currently in use for the treatment of human cancer are designed to target cancer cells (such as chemotherapy) and also to modulate the tumor microenvironment (such as antiangiogenic therapy). While some types of tumors are capable of forming metastases in virtually every organ in the body, the most frequent target organs of metastasis are bone, brain, liver and the lung.

Cells migrating in three-dimensional environments and in vivo can form a wide variety of protrusion types, including actin polymerization-driven lamellipodia, and contractility-driven blebs. The ability to switch between different protrusions has been proposed to facilitate motility in complex environments and to promote cancer dissemination. However, plasticity in protrusion formation has so far mostly been investigated in the context of transitions between amoeboid and mesenchymal migration modes, which involve substantial changes in overall cell morphology. As a result, the minimal requirements of transitions between blebs and lamellipodia, as well as the time scales on which they occur, remain unknown. To address these questions, we investigated protrusion switching during cell migration at the single cell level. Using cells that can be induced to form either blebs or lamellipodia, we systematically assessed the mechanical requirements, as well as the dynamics, of switching between protrusion types. We demonstrate that shifting the balance between actin protrusivity and actomyosin contractility leads to immediate transitions between blebs and lamellipodia in migrating cells. Switching occurred without changes in global cell shape, polarity, or cell adhesion. Furthermore, rapid transitions between blebs and lamellipodia could also be triggered upon changes in substrate adhesion during migration on micropatterned surfaces. Together, our data reveal that the type of protrusion formed by migrating cells can be dynamically controlled independently of overall cell morphology, suggesting that protrusion formation is an autonomous module in the regulatory network that controls the plasticity of cell migration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intratumor heterogeneity may foster tumor evolution and adaptation and hinder personalized-medicine strategies that depend on results from single tumor-biopsy samples.
METHODS: To examine intratumor heterogeneity, we performed exome sequencing, chromosome aberration analysis, and ploidy profiling on multiple spatially separated samples obtained from primary renal carcinomas and associated metastatic sites. We characterized the consequences of intratumor heterogeneity using immunohistochemical analysis, mutation functional analysis, and profiling of messenger RNA expression.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed branched evolutionary tumor growth, with 63 to 69\% of all somatic mutations not detectable across every tumor region. Intratumor heterogeneity was observed for a mutation within an autoinhibitory domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, correlating with S6 and 4EBP phosphorylation in vivo and constitutive activation of mTOR kinase activity in vitro. Mutational intratumor heterogeneity was seen for multiple tumor-suppressor genes converging on loss of function; SETD2, PTEN, and KDM5C underwent multiple distinct and spatially separated inactivating mutations within a single tumor, suggesting convergent phenotypic evolution. Gene-expression signatures of good and poor prognosis were detected in different regions of the same tumor. Allelic composition and ploidy profiling analysis revealed extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with 26 of 30 tumor samples from four tumors harboring divergent allelic-imbalance profiles and with ploidy heterogeneity in two of four tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Intratumor heterogeneity can lead to underestimation of the tumor genomics landscape portrayed from single tumor-biopsy samples and may present major challenges to personalized-medicine and biomarker development. Intratumor heterogeneity, associated with heterogeneous protein function, may foster tumor adaptation and therapeutic failure through Darwinian selection.

	abstract = {Cisplatin is one of the most effective broad-spectrum anticancer drugs. Its effectiveness seems to be due to the unique properties of cisplatin, which enters cells via multiple pathways and forms multiple different DNA-platinum adducts while initiating a cellular self-defense system by activating or silencing a variety of different genes, resulting in dramatic epigenetic and/or genetic alternations. As a result, the development of cisplatin resistance in human cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by necessity stems from bewilderingly complex genetic and epigenetic changes in gene expression and alterations in protein localization. Extensive published evidence has demonstrated that pleiotropic alterations are frequently detected during development of resistance to this toxic metal compound. Changes occur in almost every mechanism supporting cell survival, including cell growth-promoting pathways, apoptosis, developmental pathways, DNA damage repair, and endocytosis. In general, dozens of genes are affected in cisplatin-resistant cells, including pathways involved in copper metabolism as well as transcription pathways that alter the cytoskeleton, change cell surface presentation of proteins, and regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Decreased accumulation is one of the most common features resulting in cisplatin resistance. This seems to be a consequence of numerous epigenetic and genetic changes leading to the loss of cell-surface binding sites and/or transporters for cisplatin, and decreased fluid phase endocytosis.},

	abstract = {Multiple factors are involved in the etiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Pathological changes occur in a variety of cell types long before symptoms become apparent and diagnosis is made. Dysregulation of physiological functions are associated with the activation of immune cells, leading to local and finally systemic inflammation that is characterized by production of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Patients suffering from inflammatory diseases often present with diminished levels of antioxidants either due to insufficient dietary intake or, and even more likely, due to increased demand in situations of overwhelming ROS production by activated immune effector cells like macrophages. Antioxidants are suggested to beneficially interfere with diseases-related oxidative stress, however the interplay of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants with the overall redox system is complex. Moreover, molecular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress in CVD are not fully elucidated. Metabolic dybalances are suggested to play a major role in disease onset and progression. Several central signaling pathways involved in the regulation of immunological, metabolic and endothelial function are regulated in a redox-sensitive manner. During cellular immune response, interferon γ-dependent pathways are activated such as tryptophan breakdown by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in monocyte-derived macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial and epithelial cells. Neopterin, a marker of oxidative stress and immune activation is produced by GTP-cyclohydrolase I in macrophages and dendritic cells. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is induced in several cell types to generate nitric oxide (NO). NO, despite its low reactivity, is a potent antioxidant involved in the regulation of the vasomotor tone and of immunomodulatory signaling pathways. NO inhibits the expression and function of IDO. Function of NOS requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is produced in humans primarily by fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Highly toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is formed solely in the presence of superoxide anion (O2-). Neopterin and kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (Kyn/Trp), as an estimate of IDO enzyme activity, are robust markers of immune activation in vitro and in vivo. Both these diagnostic parameters are able to predict cardiovascular and overall mortality in patients at risk. Likewise, a significant association exists between increase of neopterin concentrations and Kyn/Trp ratio values and the lowering of plasma levels of vitamin-C, -E and -B. Vitamin-B deficiency is usually accompanied by increased plasma homoycsteine. Additional determination of NO metabolites, BH4 and plasma antioxidants in patients with CVD and related clinical settings can be helpful to improve the understanding of redox-regulation in health and disease and might provide a rationale for potential antioxidant therapies in CVD.},

	abstract = {Fatigue is the most common side effect of chemotherapy. However, the mechanisms of "muscle fatigue" induced by anti-cancer drugs are not fully understood. We therefore investigated the muscle-atrophic effect of cisplatin, a platinum-based anti-cancer drug, in mice. C57BL/6J mice were treated with cisplatin (3mg/kg, i.p.) or saline for 4 consecutive days. On Day 5, hindlimb and quadriceps muscles were isolated from mice. The loss of body weight and food intake under the administration of cisplatin was the same as those in a dietary restriction (DR) group. Under the present conditions, the administration of cisplatin significantly decreased not only the muscle mass of the hindlimb and quadriceps but also the myofiber diameter, compared to those in the DR group. The mRNA expression levels of muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx), muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF1) and forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) were significantly and further increased by cisplatin treated group, compared to DR. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of myostatin and p21 were significantly upregulated by the administration of cisplatin, compared to DR. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a, which leads to the blockade of the upregulation of MuRF1 and MAFbx, was significantly and dramatically decreased by cisplatin. These findings suggest that the administration of cisplatin increases atrophic gene expression, and may lead to an imbalance between protein synthesis and protein degradation pathways, which would lead to muscle atrophy. This phenomenon could, at least in part, explain the mechanism of cisplatin-induced muscle fatigue.},

DMD is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and a shortened life span, and there is no effective treatment. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9)–mediated genome editing to correct the dystrophin gene (Dmd) mutation in the germ line of mdx mice, a model for DMD, and then monitored muscle structure and function. Genome editing produced genetically mosaic animals containing 2 to 100\% correction of the Dmd gene. The degree of muscle phenotypic rescue in mosaic mice exceeded the efficiency of gene correction, likely reflecting an advantage of the corrected cells and their contribution to regenerating muscle. With the anticipated technological advances that will facilitate genome editing of postnatal somatic cells, this strategy may one day allow correction of disease-causing mutations in the muscle tissue of patients with DMD.
Genome editing corrects a muscle disease
Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy find their muscles growing progressively weaker. Studies identified dystrophin as the culprit gene, which galvanized research into gene-targeted therapies. Long et al. apply genome editing to “correct” the disease-causing mutation in mice genetically destined to develop the disease. This germline editing strategy kept muscles from degenerating, even in mice harboring only a small percentage of corrected cells. Although not feasible for humans, this proof of concept sets the stage for applying genome editing to specific cell types involved in the disease.

These approaches have, however, a number of disadvantages such as transient effects or adverse immune complications. We report here the use of antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) to manipulate myostatin pre-mRNA splicing and knockdown myostatin expression. Both 2'O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA (2'OMePS) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) led to efficient exon skipping in vitro and in vivo and knockdown of myostatin at the transcript level. The substantial myostatin exon skipping observed after systemic injection of Vivo-PMO into normal mice led to a significant increase in soleus muscle mass as compared to the controls injected with normal saline suggesting that this approach could be feasible to ameliorate muscle-wasting pathologies.},

However, the results of these studies may have been confounded by interactions of rhIGF-I with endogenous IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). To date, no study has examined whether inhibiting IGFBP interactions with endogenous IGF-I can improve muscle fiber regeneration or muscular pathologies. We tested the hypothesis that reducing IGFBP interactions with endogenous IGF-I would enhance muscle regeneration after myotoxic injury and improve the dystrophic pathology in mdx mice. We administered an IGF-I aptamer (NBI-31772; 6 mg/kg per day, continuous infusion) to C57BL/10 mice undergoing regeneration after myotoxic injury or to mdx dystrophic mice. NBI-31772 binds all six IGFBPs with high affinity and releases “free” endogenous IGF-I. NBI-31772 treatment increased the rate of functional repair in fast-twitch tibialis anterior muscles after notexin-induced injury as evidenced by an increase in maximum force producing capacity (Po) at 10 days after injury. In contrast, NBI-31772 administration for 28 days did not alter Po of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles or normalized force of diaphragm muscle strips from mdx mice. Although IGFBP inhibition reduced the susceptibility of the fast-twitch EDL and the diaphragm muscle to contraction-mediated damage, it increased muscle fatigability during repeated maximal contractions. Although the results in the myotoxic injury model suggest IGF-I signaling is important in this model, the results in the mdx model are mixed.},

	abstract = {The insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are a family of six proteins that bind to insulin-like growth factor-I and -II with very high affinity. Because their affinity constants are between two- and 50-fold greater than the IGF-I receptor, they control the distribution of the IGFs among soluble IGFBPs in interstitial fluids, IGFBPs bound to cell surfaces or extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell surface receptors. Although there are six forms of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, most interstitial fluids contain only three or four forms, and usually only one or two predominate. The proteins differ significantly in their biochemical characteristics, and this accounts for many of the differences that have been observed in their biological actions. Several different types of protease cleave these binding proteins. Proteolytic cleavage generally inactivates the binding proteins or reduces their ability to bind to IGF-I or -II substantially. Several cell types have been shown to secrete these proteases; therefore, the factors that regulate protease activity can control binding protein actions indirectly. Other post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, have been shown to alter IGF binding protein activity. While binding protein actions have been studied extensively in vitro, many of the in vivo activities of these proteins remain to be defined.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nephrotoxicity is one of the main side effects of the anticancer drug cisplatin, and one of its main therapeutic limitations. It has been suggested that p53 activation plays important roles in renal cell injury by cisplatin. However, the mechanism of p53 activation by cisplatin is unclear. This study examined whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by cisplatin would be linked to p53 activation in rat mesangial cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Renal cells were incubated with cisplatin in the absence or presence of pifithrin-a (PFT), N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), or dimethylthiourea (DMT). Cell viability was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase-3 activity and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The relative levels of ROS and p53 phosphorylation were determined by fluorometric assay and Western blot analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: Cisplatin induced apoptotic cell death via caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, and also increased p53 activation and ROS production. The p53 inhibitor PFT inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis. NAC and DMT, two antioxidants, also inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, NAC and DMT reduced ROS production and suppressed p53 activation in renal cells exposed to cisplatin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the ability of cisplatin to induce apoptosis of rat mesangial cells requires ROS-dependent p53 activation, thus, supporting the potential therapeutic role of antioxidants in preventing the cisplatin nephrotoxicity.},

To identify possible myostatin inhibitors that may have applications for promoting muscle growth, we investigated the regulation of myostatin signaling. Myostatin protein purified from mammalian cells consisted of a noncovalently held complex of the N-terminal propeptide and a disulfide-linked dimer of C-terminal fragments. The purified C-terminal myostatin dimer was capable of binding the activin type II receptors, Act RIIB and, to a lesser extent, Act RIIA. Binding of myostatin to Act RIIB could be inhibited by the activin-binding protein follistatin and, at higher concentrations, by the myostatin propeptide. To determine the functional significance of these interactions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of the propeptide, follistatin, or a dominant-negative form of Act RIIB by using a skeletal muscle-specific promoter. Independent transgenic mouse lines for each construct exhibited dramatic increases in muscle mass comparable to those seen in myostatin knockout mice. Our findings suggest that the propeptide, follistatin, or other molecules that block signaling through this pathway may be useful agents for enhancing muscle growth for both human therapeutic and agricultural applications.},

Recent advances following the identification of markers for these cells (including Pax7, Myf5, c-Met and CD34) (CD, cluster of differentiation; c-Met, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor) have led to a greater understanding of the role played by satellite cells in the regeneration of new skeletal muscle during growth and following injury. In response to muscle damage, satellite cells harbour the ability both to form myogenic precursors and to self-renew to repopulate the stem cell niche following myofibre damage. More recently, other stem cell populations including bone marrow stem cells, skeletal muscle side population cells and mesoangioblasts have also been shown to have myogenic potential in culture, and to be able to form skeletal muscle myofibres in vivo and engraft into the satellite cell niche. These cell types, along with satellite cells, have shown potential when used as a therapy for skeletal muscle wasting disorders where the intrinsic stem cell population is genetically unable to repair non-functioning muscle tissue. Accurate understanding of the mechanisms controlling satellite cell lineage progression and self-renewal as well as the recruitment of other stem cell types towards the myogenic lineage is crucial if we are to exploit the power of these cells in combating myopathic conditions.

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies have increased our understanding of the activation of satellite cells within their niche on the muscle fibre, the contribution of satellite cell-derived muscle precursor cells to skeletal muscle regeneration and the reduction of satellite cell function in old muscle. Although other stem cells, either bone marrow derived or present within skeletal muscle or other tissues, do contribute to muscle regeneration, recent studies have highlighted that this is at best minimal compared with the ability of satellite cells to regenerate skeletal muscle. The effect of the host muscle environment has been shown to have a profound effect on skeletal muscle regeneration. Age and denervation have a detrimental effect and certain types of muscle injury a positive effect. Work continues on the effect of growth factors on muscle cell lines in vitro and muscle regeneration in vivo.
SUMMARY: Recent work has focused on the contribution of satellite-cell derived muscle precursor cells and other stem cells to skeletal muscle regeneration. The muscle environment has a profound effect on the regenerative capacity of resident and implanted cells. Muscle regeneration may be optimized by using the best stem cell population and by modifying the host muscle environment.},

Cell-based therapies were used to promote muscle regeneration with the hope that the host cells repopulated the muscle and improved muscle function and pathology. Stem cells were preferable for therapeutic applications, due to their capacity of self-renewal and differentiative potential. In the last years, encouraging results were obtained with adult stem cells to treat muscular dystrophies. Adult stem cells were found into various tissues of the body and they were able to maintain, generate, and replace terminally differentiated cells within their own specific tissue because of cell turnover or tissue injury. Moreover, it became clear that these cells could participate into regeneration of more than just their resident organ. Here, we described multiple types of muscle and non muscle-derived myogenic stem cells, their characterization and their possible use to treat muscular dystrophies. We also underlined that most promising possibility for the management and therapy of DMD is a combination of different approaches, such as gene and stem cell therapy.},

This mini-review looks at recent developments in basic research that are relevant to the loss of skeletal muscle. It aims to cover the most significant publication of last three years on the causes and effects of muscle wasting, new targets for therapy development and potential biomarkers for assessing skeletal muscle mass. The targets include 1) E-3 ligases: TRIM32, SOCS1 and SOCS3 by involving the elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase, Cbl-b, culling 7, Fbxo40, MG53 (TRIM72) and the mitochondrial Mul1, 2) the kinase MST1 and 3) the G-protein Gαi2. D(3)-creatine has the potential to be used as a novel biomarker that allows to monitor actual change in skeletal muscle mass over time. In conclusion, significant development efforts are being made by academic groups as well as numerous pharmaceutical companies to identify new targets and biomarkers muscle, as muscle wasting represents a great medical need, but no therapies have been approved in the last decades.},

	abstract = {Some of the most serious consequences of ageing are its effects on skeletal muscle. The term ‘sarcopenia’ describes the slow but progressive loss of muscle mass with advancing age and is characterised by a deterioration of muscle quantity and quality leading to a gradual slowing of movement and a decline in strength. The loss of muscle mass and strength is thought to be attributed to the progressive atrophy and loss of individual muscle fibres associated with the loss of motor units, and a concomitant reduction in muscle ‘quality’ due to the infiltration of fat and other non-contractile material. These age-related changes in skeletal muscle can be largely attributed to the complex interaction of factors affecting neuromuscular transmission, muscle architecture, fibre composition, excitation–contraction coupling, and metabolism. Given the magnitude of the growing public health problems associated with sarcopenia, there is considerable interest in the development and evaluation of therapeutic strategies to attenuate, prevent, or ultimately reverse age-related muscle wasting and weakness. The aim is to review our current understanding of some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for age-related changes in skeletal muscle.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Weight loss and low BMI due to an underlying illness have been associated with increased mortality, reduced functional capacity, and diminished quality of life. There is a need for well tolerated, long-term approaches to maintain body weight in patients with cachexia or wasting. The purpose of this review is to highlight the scientific and clinical evidence derived from the recent literature investigating the rationale for and potential medical use of creatine supplementation in patients with cachexia or wasting.
RECENT FINDINGS: Some studies have demonstrated that supplementation with creatine can increase creatine reserves in skeletal muscle and increase muscle mass and performance in various disease states that affect muscle size and function. The mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear. It has been suggested that creatine supplementation may increase intramuscular phosphocreatine stores and promote more rapid recovery of adenosine triphosphate levels following exercise, thus allowing users to exercise for longer periods or at higher intensity levels. Other hypothesized mechanisms include attenuation of proinflammatory cytokines, stimulation of satellite cell proliferation and upregulation of genes that promote protein synthesis and cell repair.
SUMMARY: Creatine is a generally well tolerated, low-cost, over-the-counter nutritional supplement that shows potential in improving lean body mass and functionality in patients with wasting diseases. However, placebo-controlled studies have shown variable effects, with improvements in some and not in others. Additional studies with longer follow-up are required to identify the populations that might benefit most from creatine supplementation.},

	abstract = {Cisplatin is one of the most potent antitumor agents known, displaying clinical activity against a wide variety of solid tumors. Its cytotoxic mode of action is mediated by its interaction with DNA to form DNA adducts, primarily intrastrand crosslink adducts, which activate several signal transduction pathways, including those involving ATR, p53, p73, and MAPK, and culminate in the activation of apoptosis. DNA damage-mediated apoptotic signals, however, can be attenuated, and the resistance that ensues is a major limitation of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The mechanisms responsible for cisplatin resistance are several, and contribute to the multifactorial nature of the problem. Resistance mechanisms that limit the extent of DNA damage include reduced drug uptake, increased drug inactivation, and increased DNA adduct repair. Origins of these pharmacologic-based mechanisms, however, are at the molecular level. Mechanisms that inhibit propagation of the DNA damage signal to the apoptotic machinery include loss of damage recognition, overexpression of HER-2/neu, activation of the PI3-K/Akt (also known as PI3-K/PKB) pathway, loss of p53 function, overexpression of antiapoptotic bcl-2, and interference in caspase activation. The molecular signature defining the resistant phenotype varies between tumors, and the number of resistance mechanisms activated in response to selection pressures dictates the overall extent of cisplatin resistance.},

Here we analysed CisPt-induced atrophy in C2C12 myotubes by a multidisciplinary morphological approach, focusing on the onset and progression of autophagy, a protective cellular process that, when excessively activated, may trigger protein hypercatabolism and atrophy in skeletal muscle. To visualize autophagy we used confocal and transmission electron microscopy at different times of treatment and doses of CisPt. Moreover we evaluated the effects of taurine, a cytoprotective beta-amino acid able to counteract oxidative stress, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in different tissues and organs. Our microscopic results indicate that autophagy occurs very early in 50  μM CisPt challenged myotubes (4 h-8 h) before overt atrophy but it persists even at 24 h, when several autophagic vesicles, damaged mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic blebbings engulf the sarcoplasm. Differently, 25 mM taurine pretreatment rescues the majority of myotubes size upon 50  μM CisPt at 24 h. Taurine appears to counteract atrophy by restoring regular microtubular apparatus and mitochondria and reducing the overload and the localization of autophagolysosomes. Such a promising taurine action in preventing atrophy needs further molecular and biochemical studies to best define its impact on muscle homeostasis and the maintenance of an adequate skeletal mass in vivo.},

However, evidence suggests active uptake and efflux mechanisms are involved; this may be involved also in other experimental metal coordination and organometallic compounds with promising antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo, such as ruthenium and gold compounds. Such knowledge would be necessary to elucidate the balance between activity and toxicity profiles of metal compounds.

	issn = {0005-0423},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the infectivity and transmissibility of Hendra virus (HeV).
DESIGN: A disease transmission study using fruit bats, horses and cats.
PROCEDURE: Eight grey-headed fruit bats (Pteropus poliocephalus) were inoculated and housed in contact with three uninfected bats and two uninfected horses. In a second experiment, four horses were inoculated by subcutaneous injection and intranasal inoculation and housed in contact with three uninfected horses and six uninfected cats. In a third experiment, 12 cats were inoculated and housed in contact with three uninfected horses. Two surviving horses were inoculated at the conclusion of the third experiment: the first orally and the second by nasal swabbing. All animals were necropsied and examined by gross and microscopic pathological methods, immunoperoxidase to detect viral antigen in formalin-fixed tissues, virus isolation was attempted on tissues and SNT and ELISA methods were used to detect HeV-specific antibody.
RESULTS: Clinical disease was not observed in the fruit bats, although six of eight inoculated bats developed antibody against HeV, and two of six developed vascular lesions which contained viral antigen. The in-contact bats and horses did not seroconvert. Three of four horses that were inoculated developed acute disease, but in-contact horses and cats were not infected. In the third experiment, one of three in-contact horses contracted disease. At the time of necropsy, high titres of HeV were detected in the kidneys of six acutely infected horses, in the urine of four horses and the mouth of two, but not in the nasal cavities or tracheas.
CONCLUSIONS: Grey-headed fruit bats seroconvert and develop subclinical disease when inoculated with HeV. Horses can be infected by oronasal routes and can excrete HeV in urine and saliva. It is possible to transmit HeV from cats to horses. Transmission from P poliocephalus to horses could not be proven and neither could transmission from horses to horses or horses to cats. Under the experimental conditions of the study the virus is not highly contagious.},

In this article, early landmarks in skeletal muscle research are reviewed and recent findings on myogenesis are addressed with particular focus on novel regulatory molecules including miRNAs, as well as on the topographical heterogeneity of skeletal muscle origin. The latter has developed into a central theme of keen interest in the past years, particularly since overlaps in genetic and embryological background between head muscle subsets and heart muscle have been described. As embryonic myogenesis and regenerating myofibers employ common molecules, the heterogeneity in embryonic sources from which skeletal muscle groups in the vertebrate body take origin is closely reflected by differences in the susceptibility to particular muscle dystrophies as well as their regeneration potential. In the regeneration chapter of this review the progress that has been made in the field of muscle stem cell biology, with special focus on the satellite cells, is outlined. Satellite cells are considered the most promising source of muscle stem cells possessing a high regenerative potential. We shall discuss recent insights into the heterogeneous nature of these satellite cells not just in terms of their expression profile but also their regeneration potential. Latest findings about the motility of the satellite cell shall also be discussed. Furthermore, we shall outline the impact of an improved understanding of muscle stem cells within their environment, and of satellite cells in particular, on efficient stem cell replacement therapies for muscular dystrophies, putting embryological findings and stem cell approaches into context.},

Muscles expressing the smallest dystrophins are fully protected against damage caused by muscle activity and are not morphologically different from normal muscle. Moreover, injection of adeno-associated viruses carrying micro-dystrophins into dystrophic muscles of immunocompetent mdx mice results in a striking reversal of histopathological features of this disease.

	abstract = {The limited packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) precludes the design of vectors for the treatment of diseases associated with larger genes. Autonomous parvoviruses, such as minute virus of mice and B19, while identical in size (25 nm), are known to package larger genomes of 5.1 and 5.6 kb, respectively, compared to AAV genomes of 4.7 kb. One primary difference is the fact that wild-type (wt) AAV utilizes three capsid subunits instead of two to form the virion shell. In this study, we have characterized the packaging capacity of AAV serotypes 1 through 5 with and without the Vp2 subunit. Using reporter transgene cassettes that range in size from 4.4 to 6.0 kb, we determined that serotypes 1 through 5 with and without Vp2 could successfully package, replicate in, and transduce cells. Dot blot analysis established that packaging efficiency was similar for all vector cassettes and that the integrity of encapsidated genomes was intact regardless of size. Although physical characterization determined that virion structures were indistinguishable from wt, transduction experiments determined that all serotype vectors carrying larger genomes (5.3 kb and higher) transduced cells less efficiently (within a log) than AAV encapsidating wt size genomes. This result was not unique to reporter genes and was observed for CFTR vector cassettes ranging in size from 5.1 to 5.9 kb. No apparent advantage in packaging efficiency was observed when Vp2 was present or absent from the virion. Further analysis determined that a postentry step was responsible for the block in infection and specific treatment of cells upon infection with proteasome inhibitors increased transduction of AAV encapsidating larger DNA templates to wt levels, suggesting a preferential degradation of virions encapsidating larger-than-wt genomes. This study illustrates that AAV is capable of packaging and protecting recombinant genomes as large as 6.0 kb but the larger genome-containing virions are preferentially degraded by the proteasome and that this block can be overcome by the addition of proteasome inhibitors.},

It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that disrupt the open reading frame (ORF) preventing the production of functional dystrophin protein. The loss of dystrophin ultimately leads to the degeneration of muscle fibres, progressive weakness and premature death. Antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) targeted to splicing elements within DMD pre-mRNA can induce the skipping of targeted exons, restoring the ORF and the consequent production of a shorter but functional dystrophin protein. This approach may lead to an effective disease modifying treatment for DMD and progress towards clinical application has been rapid. Less than a decade has passed between the first studies published in 1998 describing the use of AOs to modify the DMD gene in mice and the results of the first intramuscular proof of concept clinical trials. Whilst phase II and III trials are now underway, the heterogeneity of DMD mutations, efficient systemic delivery and targeting of AOs to cardiac muscle remain significant challenges. Here we review the current status of AO-mediated therapy for DMD, discussing the preclinical, clinical and regulatory hurdles and their possible solutions to expedite the translation of AO-mediated exon skipping therapy to clinic.},

Mitochondrial effects of cannabinoids were interpreted either as non-receptor-mediated alteration of mitochondrial membranes, or as indirect consequences of activation of plasma membrane type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1). Recently, CB1 receptors were confirmed to be localized to the membranes of neuronal mitochondria, where their activation directly regulates respiration and energy production. Here, we performed in-depth analysis of cannabinoid-induced changes of mitochondrial respiration using both an antagonist/inverse agonist of CB1 receptors, AM251 and the cannabinoid receptor agonists, Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol, anandamide, and WIN 55,212-2. Relationships were determined between cannabinoid concentration and respiratory rate driven by substrates of complex I, II or IV in pig brain mitochondria. Either full or partial inhibition of respiratory rate was found for the tested drugs, with an IC50 in the micromolar range, which verified the significant role of non-receptor-mediated mechanism in inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Effect of stepwise application of THC and AM251 evidenced protective role of AM251 and corroborated the participation of CB1 receptor activation in the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. We proposed a model, which includes both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated mechanisms of cannabinoid action on mitochondrial respiration. This model explains both the inhibitory effect of cannabinoids and the protective effect of the CB1 receptor inverse agonist.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria are an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed as a side product of oxidative phosphorylation. The main sites of oxidant production are complex I and complex III, where electrons flowing from reduced substrates are occasionally transferred to oxygen to form superoxide anion and derived products. These highly reactive compounds have a well-known role in pathological states and in some cellular responses. However, although their link with Ca(2+) is well studied in cell death, it has been hardly investigated in normal cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) signals. Several Ca(2+) transport systems are modulated by oxidation. Oxidation increases the activity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors, the main channels releasing Ca(2+) from intracellular stores in response to cellular stimulation. On the other hand, mitochondria are known to control [Ca(2+)](i) signals by Ca(2+) uptake and release during cytosolic calcium mobilization, specially in mitochondria situated close to Ca(2+) release channels. Mitochondrial inhibitors modify calcium signals in numerous cell types, including oscillations evoked by physiological stimulus. Although these inhibitors reduce mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, they also impair ROS production in several systems. In keeping with this effect, recent reports show that antioxidants or oxidant scavengers also inhibit physiological calcium signals. Furthermore, there is evidence that mitochondria generate ROS in response to cell stimulation, an effect suppressed by mitochondrial inhibitors that simultaneously block [Ca(2+)](i) signals. Together, the data reviewed here indicate that Ca(2+)-mobilizing stimulus generates mitochondrial ROS, which, in turn, facilitate [Ca(2+)](i) signals, a new aspect in the biology of mitochondria. Finally, the potential implications for biological modeling are discussed.},

	abstract = {Heavy marijuana use has been linked to white matter histological alterations. However, the impact of cannabis constituents on oligodendroglial pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the in vitro effects of cannabidiol, the main nonpsychoactive marijuana component, on oligodendrocytes. Exposure to cannabidiol induced an intracellular Ca(2+) rise in optic nerve oligodendrocytes that was not primarily mediated by entry from the extracellular space, nor by interactions with ryanodine or IP(3) receptors. Application of the mitochondrial protonophore carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; 1 μM) completely prevented subsequent cannabidiol-induced Ca(2+) responses. Conversely, the increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels elicited by FCCP was reduced after previous exposure to cannabidiol, further suggesting that the mitochondria acts as the source of cannabidiol-evoked Ca(2+) rise in oligodendrocytes. n addition, brief exposure to cannabidiol (100 nM-10 μM) led to a concentration-dependent decrease of oligodendroglial viability that was not prevented by antagonists of CB(1), CB(2), vanilloid, A(2A) or PPARγ receptors, but was instead reduced in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). The oligodendrotoxic effect of cannabidiol was partially blocked by inhibitors of caspase-3, -8 and -9, PARP-1 and calpains, suggesting the activation of caspase-dependent and -independent death pathways. Cannabidiol also elicited a concentration-dependent alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was reduced in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). Finally, cannabidiol-induced cytotoxicity was partially prevented by the ROS scavenger trolox. Together, these results suggest that cannabidiol causes intracellular Ca(2+) dysregulation which can lead to oligodendrocytes demise.},

	abstract = {Cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system have attracted considerable interest for therapeutic applications. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action of one of the main nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD), remains elusive despite potentially beneficial properties as an anti-convulsant and neuroprotectant. Here, we characterize the mechanisms by which CBD regulates Ca(2+) homeostasis and mediates neuroprotection in neuronal preparations. Imaging studies in hippocampal cultures using fura-2 AM suggested that CBD-mediated Ca(2+) regulation is bidirectional, depending on the excitability of cells. Under physiological K(+)/Ca(2+) levels, CBD caused a subtle rise in [Ca(2+)](i), whereas CBD reduced [Ca(2+)](i) and prevented Ca(2+) oscillations under high-excitability conditions (high K(+) or exposure to the K(+) channel antagonist 4AP). Regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) was not primarily mediated by interactions with ryanodine or IP(3) receptors of the endoplasmic reticulum. Instead, dual-calcium imaging experiments with a cytosolic (fura-2 AM) and a mitochondrial (Rhod-FF, AM) fluorophore implied that mitochondria act as sinks and sources for CBD's [Ca(2+)](i) regulation. Application of carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor, CGP 37157, but not the mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporin A, prevented subsequent CBD-induced Ca(2+) responses. In established human neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y) treated with mitochondrial toxins, CBD (0.1 and 1 microm) was neuroprotective against the uncoupler FCCP (53\% protection), and modestly protective against hydrogen peroxide- (16\%) and oligomycin- (15\%) mediated cell death, a pattern also confirmed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Thus, under pathological conditions involving mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca(2+) dysregulation, CBD may prove beneficial in preventing apoptotic signaling via a restoration of Ca(2+) homeostasis.},

Activated FoxO1 inhibits mTORC1 by TSC2-dependent and TSC2-independent mechanisms. First, FoxO1 induces Sestrin3 (Sesn3) gene expression. Sesn3, in turn, inhibits mTORC1 activity in Tsc2-proficient cells. Second, FoxO1 elevates the expression of Rictor, leading to increased mTORC2 activity that consequently activates Akt. In Tsc2-deficient cells, the elevation of Rictor by FoxO increases mTORC2 assembly and activity at the expense of mTORC1, thereby activating Akt while inhibiting mTORC1. FoxO may act as a rheostat that maintains homeostatic balance between Akt and mTOR complexes' activities. In response to physiological stresses, FoxO maintains high Akt activity and low mTORC1 activity. Thus, under stress conditions, FoxO inhibits the anabolic activity of mTORC1, a major consumer of cellular energy, while activating Akt, which increases cellular energy metabolism, thereby maintaining cellular energy homeostasis.},

However, more than a generation after its clinical introduction, its exact mechanism of action on tumor cells is not fully defined. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of oxidative stress as a mediator of cisplatin action on colon cancer cells, studying the influence of mitochondrial physiology and composition on its effectiveness. The chemosensitivity shown by cancer cells to mechanistically dissimilar antitumor drugs is shown to be associated with their capacity to induce early alterations in mitochondrial and redox metabolism. Specifically, cisplatin exerted a marked pro-oxidative action on mitochondria by inhibiting resting respiration and stimulating the immediate generation of ROS in isolated mitochondria. Antioxidants and mitochondrial uncouplers counteracted cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in tumor cells, reflecting that oxidative stress and the inhibition of mitochondrial uncoupling are relevant to its antiproliferative activity. Additionally, inhibition of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) caused cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells via ROS of mitochondrial origin. In conclusion, we show for the first time that UCP2 knockdown participates in the mechanism of action of cisplatin, thus providing evidence that targeting UCP2 may offer clinical benefit in the treatment of cancer.},

	abstract = {Cisplatin is one of the most effective and widely used anticancer agents for the treatment of several types of tumors. The cytotoxic effect of cisplatin is thought to be mediated primarily by the generation of nuclear DNA adducts, which, if not repaired, cause cell death as a consequence of DNA replication and transcription blockage. However, the ability of cisplatin to induce nuclear DNA (nDNA) damage per se is not sufficient to explain its high degree of effectiveness nor the toxic effects exerted on normal, post-mitotic tissues. Oxidative damage has been observed in vivo following exposure to cisplatin in several tissues, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced dose-limiting toxicities. However, the mechanism of cisplatin-induced generation of ROS and their contribution to cisplatin cytotoxicity in normal and cancer cells is still poorly understood. By employing a panel of normal and cancer cell lines and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model system, we show that exposure to cisplatin induces a mitochondrial-dependent ROS response that significantly enhances the cytotoxic effect caused by nDNA damage. ROS generation is independent of the amount of cisplatin-induced nDNA damage and occurs in mitochondria as a consequence of protein synthesis impairment. The contribution of cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in determining its cytotoxic effect varies among cells and depends on mitochondrial redox status, mitochondrial DNA integrity and bioenergetic function. Thus, by manipulating these cellular parameters, we were able to enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity in cancer cells. This study provides a new mechanistic insight into cisplatin-induced cell killing and may lead to the design of novel therapeutic strategies to improve anticancer drug efficacy.},

Animal models, primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia neurons and tumour cell-lines of neuronal origin are being used in attempts to identify potential treatments for platinum-induced neurotoxicity. To date, clinical trials have been hampered by the poor tolerance of neuroprotective treatments and failure to achieve reversal of platinum drug neurotoxicity with thiols, neurotrophic factors or calcium channel blockers.},

In fact, DRG energy failure has been suggested as a result of mitochondrial DNA-platinum binding and several antioxidant drugs have been tested in pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials.

	abstract = {The satellite cell of skeletal muscle provides a paradigm for quiescent and activated tissue stem cell states. We have carried out transcriptome analyses on satellite cells purified by flow cytometry from Pax3(GFP/+) mice. We compared samples from adult skeletal muscles where satellite cells are mainly quiescent, with samples from growing muscles or regenerating (mdx) muscles, where they are activated. Analysis of regulation that is shared by both activated states avoids other effects due to immature or pathological conditions. This in vivo profile differs from that of previously analyzed satellite cells activated after cell culture. It reveals how the satellite cell protects itself from damage and maintains quiescence, while being primed for activation on receipt of the appropriate signal. This is illustrated by manipulation of the corepressor Dach1, and by the demonstration that quiescent satellite cells are better protected from oxidative stress than those from mdx or 1-week-old muscles. The quiescent versus in vivo activated comparison also gives new insights into how the satellite cell controls its niche on the muscle fiber through cell adhesion and matrix remodeling. The latter also potentiates growth factor activity through proteoglycan modification. Dismantling the extracellular matrix is important for satellite cell activation when the expression of proteinases is up-regulated, whereas transcripts for their inhibitors are high in quiescent cells. In keeping with this, we demonstrate that metalloproteinase function is required for efficient regeneration in vivo.},

	abstract = {Satellite cells are the resident stem cells of adult skeletal muscle. As with all stem cells, how the choice between self-renewal or differentiation is controlled is central to understanding their function. Here, we have explored the role of β-catenin in determining the fate of myogenic satellite cells. Satellite cells express β-catenin, and expression is maintained as they activate and undergo proliferation. Constitutive retroviral-driven expression of wild-type or stabilised β-catenin results in more satellite cells expressing Pax7 without any MyoD – therefore, adopting the self-renewal pathway, with fewer cells undergoing myogenic differentiation. Similarly, preventing the degradation of endogenous β-catenin by inhibiting GSK3β activity also results in more Pax7-positive–MyoD-negative (Pax7+MyoD–) satellite-cell progeny. Consistent with these observations, downregulation of β-catenin using small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the proportion of satellite cells that express Pax7 and augmented myogenic differentiation after mitogen withdrawal. Since a dominant-negative version of β-catenin had the same effect as silencing β-catenin using specific siRNA, β-catenin promotes self-renewal via transcriptional control of target genes. Thus, β-catenin signalling in proliferating satellite cells directs these cells towards the self-renewal pathway and, so, contributes to the maintenance of this stem-cell pool in adult skeletal muscle.},

Silencing of Fzd7 abrogated Wnt7a binding and stimulation of stem cell expansion. Wnt7a signaling induced the polarized distribution of the planar cell polarity effector Vangl2. Silencing of Vangl2 inhibited Wnt7a action on satellite stem cell expansion. Wnt7a overexpression enhanced muscle regeneration and increased both satellite cell numbers and the proportion of satellite stem cells.

As few as seven satellite cells associated with one transplanted myofiber can generate over 100 new myofibers containing thousands of myonuclei. Moreover, the transplanted satellite cells vigorously self-renew, expanding in number and repopulating the host muscle with new satellite cells. Following experimental injury, these cells proliferate extensively and regenerate large compact clusters of myofibers.

Previously, we showed that Pax7 overexpression in adult primary myoblasts down-regulates MyoD and prevents myogenin induction, inhibiting myogenesis. We show that Pax7 prevents muscle differentiation independently of its transcriptional activity, affecting MyoD function. Conversely, myogenin directly affects Pax7 expression and may be critical for Pax7 down-regulation in differentiating cells. Our results provide evidence for a cross-inhibitory interaction between Pax7 and members of the muscle regulatory factor family.

Quiescent satellite cells are synchronously activated to coexpress the transcription factors Pax7 and MyoD. Most then proliferate, down-regulate Pax7, and differentiate. In contrast, other proliferating cells maintain Pax7 but lose MyoD and withdraw from immediate differentiation. These cells are typically located in clusters, together with Pax7−ve progeny destined for differentiation. Some of the Pax7+ve/MyoD−ve cells then leave the cell cycle, thus regaining the quiescent satellite cell phenotype. Significantly, noncycling cells contained within a cluster can be stimulated to proliferate again. These observations suggest that satellite cells either differentiate or switch from terminal myogenesis to maintain the satellite cell pool.},

Here we examine the function of Myf5 and Mrf4 in the adult using recently generated alleles. Mrf4 is not expressed in normal or Myf5 null satellite cells and myoblasts, therefore excluding a role for this determination gene in adult muscle progenitors. Skeletal muscles of adult Myf5 null mice exhibit a subtle progressive myopathy. Crucially, adult Myf5 null mice exhibit perturbed muscle regeneration with a significant increase in muscle fibre hypertrophy, delayed differentiation, adipocyte accumulation, and fibrosis after freeze-injury. Satellite cell numbers are not significantly altered in Myf5 null animals and they show a modest impaired proliferation under some conditions in vitro. Mice double mutant for Myf5 and Dystrophin were more severely affected than single mutants, with enhanced necrosis and regeneration.

To gain insight into the regeneration deficit of MyoD−/− muscle, we investigated the growth and differentiation of cultured MyoD−/− myogenic cells. Primary MyoD−/− myogenic cells exhibited a stellate morphology distinct from the compact morphology of wild-type myoblasts, and expressed c-met, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in satellite cells. However, MyoD−/− myogenic cells did not express desmin, an intermediate filament protein typically expressed in cultured myoblasts in vitro and myogenic precursor cells in vivo. Northern analysis indicated that proliferating MyoD−/− myogenic cells expressed fourfold higher levels of Myf-5 and sixfold higher levels of PEA3, an ETS-domain transcription factor expressed in newly activated satellite cells. Under conditions that normally induce differentiation, MyoD−/− cells continued to proliferate and with delayed kinetics yielded reduced numbers of predominantly mononuclear myocytes. Northern analysis revealed delayed induction of myogenin, MRF4, and other differentiation-specific markers although p21 was upregulated normally. Expression of M-cadherin mRNA was severely decreased whereas expression of IGF-1 was markedly increased in MyoD−/− myogenic cells. Mixing of lacZ-labeled MyoD−/− cells and wild-type myoblasts revealed a strict autonomy in differentiation potential. Transfection of a MyoD-expression cassette restored cytomorphology and rescued the differentiation deficit. We interpret these data to suggest that MyoD−/− myogenic cells represent an intermediate stage between a quiescent satellite cell and a myogenic precursor cell.},

Quiescent satellite cells express the transcription factor Pax7 and when activated, coexpress Pax7 with MyoD. Most then proliferate, downregulate Pax7 and differentiate. By contrast, others maintain Pax7 but lose MyoD and return to a state resembling quiescence. Here we show that Pax7 is able to drive transcription in quiescent and activated satellite cells, and continues to do so in those cells that subsequently cease proliferation and withdraw from immediate differentiation. We found that constitutive expression of Pax7 in satellite-cell-derived myoblasts did not affect MyoD expression or proliferation. Although maintained expression of Pax7 delayed the onset of myogenin expression it did not prevent, and was compatible with, myogenic differentiation. Constitutive Pax7 expression in a Pax7-null C2C12 subclone increased the proportion of cells expressing MyoD, showing that Pax7 can act genetically upstream of MyoD. However these Pax7-null cells were unable to differentiate into normal myotubes in the presence of Pax7. Therefore Pax7 may be involved in maintaining proliferation and preventing precocious differentiation, but does not promote quiescence.},

	abstract = {Repair and regeneration of adult skeletal muscle are mediated by satellite cells. In healthy muscle these rare mononucleate muscle precursor cells are mitotically quiescent. Upon muscle injury or degeneration, members of this self-renewing pool are activated to proliferate and then differentiate. Here we analyzed in single satellite cells the expression of a set of regulatory genes that are candidates for causal roles in satellite cell activation, maturation, and differentiation. Individual cells were identified as satellite cells and selected for analysis based on their physical association with single explanted myofibers or their position beneath the basal lamina in unperturbed muscle tissue. Using a multiplex single-cell RT-PCR assay we simultaneously monitored expression of all four MyoD family regulators of muscle determination and differentiation (MRFs) together with two candidate markers of satellite cell identity, c-met and m-cadherin. By making these measurements on large numbers of individual cells during the time course of satellite cell activation, we were able to define which expression states (possible combinations of the six genes) were represented and to specify how the representation of each state changed with time. Activated satellite cells began to express either MyoD or myf5 first among the MRFs; most cells then expressed both myf-5 and MyoD simultaneously; myogenin came on later in cells expressing both MyoD and myf5; and many cells ultimately expressed all four MRFs simultaneously. The results for fiber-associated satellite cells from either predominantly fast or slow muscles were indistinguishable from each other. The c-met receptor tyrosine kinase was also monitored because it is a candidate for mediating activation of quiescent satellite cells (Allenet al.,1995) and because it might also be a candidate molecular marker for satellite cells. A significant difficulty in studying mouse satellite cells has been the absence of molecular markers that could identify them in the quiescent state before expression of MRFs or desmin and distinguish them from fibroblasts. We show here that c-met receptor is present beneath the basal lamina on presumptive satellite cells in intact muscle and that c-met mRNA and protein are expressed by all myofiber-associated satellite cells from the time of explant through the course of activation, proliferation, and differentiation. c-met was not detected in muscle-derived fibroblasts or in other mononucleate cells from healthy muscle explants. When compared directly with m-cadherin, which has previously been suggested as a marker for quiescent satellite cells, m-cadherin mRNA was detected only in a small subset of satellite cells at early times after myofiber explant. However, at late times following activation (by 96 hr in this fiber culture system), c-met and m-cadherin were uniformly coexpressed. From the individual satellite cell expression types observed, a model of the satellite cell population at rest and during the time course of activation was generated.},

	abstract = {Insulin stimulation produced a reliable 3-fold increase in glucose uptake in primary neonatal rat myotubes, which was accompanied by a similar effect on GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α caused insulin resistance on glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation by impairing insulin stimulation of insulin receptor (IR) and IR substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, and Akt phosphorylation. Because this cytokine produced sustained activation of stress and proinflammatory kinases, we have explored the hypothesis that insulin resistance by TNF-α could be mediated by these pathways. In this study we demonstrate that pretreatment with PD169316 or SB203580, inhibitors of p38 MAPK, restored insulin signaling and normalized insulin-induced glucose uptake in the presence of TNF-α. However, in the presence of PD98059 or SP600125, inhibitors of p42/p44 MAPK or JNK, respectively, insulin resistance by TNF-α was still produced. Moreover, TNF-α produced inhibitor κB kinase (IKK)-β activation and inhibitor κB-β and -α degradation in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner, and treatment with salicylate (an inhibitor of IKK) completely restored insulin signaling. Furthermore, TNF-α produced serine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 (total and on Ser307 residue), and these effects were completely precluded by pretreatment with either PD169316 or salicylate. Consequently, TNF-α, through activation of p38 MAPK and IKK, produces serine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1, impairing its tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin and the corresponding activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, leading to insulin resistance on glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation.},

	abstract = {Redox-regulated processes are relevant to wound healing. A balance between bioavailable nitric oxide (NO) concentration and a level of oxidative and nitroxidative stress in wounds may be crucial in wound repair. The highly beneficial effect of bioavailable NO is attributed to scavenging of superoxide, which is the main component of oxidative stress. Also, the high level of NO can influence angiogenesis and endothelial/skeletal muscle cell remodeling and proliferation. However, under conditions of excessive and prolonged production of O(2)(-) in wounds, the supplementation of NO can be evolved in significant increase in nitroxidative stress due to production of peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH). ONOOH can trigger a cascade of events leading to the generation of highly reactive and damaging radicals and oxidative species. These species (mainly CO(3)(.-), NO(2)(+), NO(2), N(2)O(3), OH(.)) can impose significant damage in biological milieu and impair the process of wound healing. Therefore, a general strategy for an acceleration of the wound healing process may include an intervention(s) leading to the decrease in oxidative stress (treatment with antioxidants and/or prevention of O(2)(-) generation by uncoupled constitutive nitric oxide synthase, cNOS) and delivery of NO (treatment with NO donors, cNOS gene therapy). Here we briefly review the role of NO, and focus on O(2)(-) and ONOOH (major components of oxidative and nitroxidative stress respectively) in the normal and impaired process of wound healing.},

To examine the involvement of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) in regulation of Foxo activities and muscle atrophy, we analyzed the expression of DGC members during tail suspension, a model of unloading-induced muscle atrophy. Among several DGC members, only neuronal NOS (nNOS) quickly dislocated from the sarcolemma to the cytoplasm during tail suspension. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry revealed production of NO in atrophying muscle. nNOS-null mice showed much milder muscle atrophy after tail suspension than did wild-type mice. Importantly, nuclear accumulation of dephosphorylated Foxo3a was not evident in nNOS-null muscle, and neither MuRF-1 nor atrogin-1/MAFbx were upregulated during tail suspension. Furthermore, an nNOS-specific inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole, significantly prevented suspension-induced muscle atrophy. The NF-kappaB pathway was activated in both wild-type and nNOS-null muscle during tail suspension. We also show that nNOS was involved in the mechanism of denervation-induced atrophy. We conclude that nNOS/NO mediates muscle atrophy via regulation of Foxo transcription factors and is a new therapeutic target for disuse-induced muscle atrophy.},

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a critical role in the cellular responses to low energy levels by switching off energy-consuming pathways and switching on energy-producing pathways. However, the transcriptional mechanisms by which AMPK acts to adjust cellular energy levels are not entirely characterized. Here, we find that AMPK directly regulates mammalian FOXO3, a member of the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors known to promote resistance to oxidative stress, tumor suppression, and longevity. We show that AMPK phosphorylates human FOXO3 at six previously unidentified regulatory sites. Phosphorylation by AMPK leads to the activation of FOXO3 transcriptional activity without affecting FOXO3 subcellular localization. Using a genome-wide microarray analysis, we identify a set of target genes that are regulated by FOXO3 when phosphorylated at these six regulatory sites in mammalian cells. The regulation of FOXO3 by AMPK may play a crucial role in fine tuning gene expression programs that control energy balance and stress resistance in cells throughout life.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle size depends upon a dynamic balance between anabolic (or hypertrophic) and catabolic (or atrophic) processes. Previously, no link between the molecular mediators of atrophy and hypertrophy had been reported. We demonstrate a hierarchy between the signals which mediate hypertrophy and those which mediate atrophy: the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt pathway, which has been shown to induce hypertrophy, prevents induction of requisite atrophy mediators, namely the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases MAFbx and MuRF1. Moreover, the mechanism for this inhibition involves Akt-mediated inhibition of the FoxO family of transcription factors; a mutant form of FOXO1, which prevents Akt phosphorylation, thereby prevents Akt-mediated inhibition of MuRF1 and MAFbx upregulation. Our study thus defines a previously uncharacterized function for Akt, which has important therapeutic relevance: Akt is not only capable of activating prosynthetic pathways, as previously demonstrated, but is simultaneously and dominantly able to suppress catabolic pathways, allowing it to prevent glucocorticoid and denervation-induced muscle atrophy.},

The same programmed deficits in muscle structure and function are found in numerous neurodegenerative syndromes and disease-related cachexia. We have generated a model of persistent, functional myocyte hypertrophy using a tissue-restricted transgene encoding a locally acting isoform of insulin-like growth factor-1 that is expressed in skeletal muscle (mIgf-1). Transgenic embryos developed normally, and postnatal increases in muscle mass and strength were not accompanied by the additional pathological changes seen in other Igf-1 transgenic models. Expression of GATA-2, a transcription factor normally undetected in skeletal muscle, marked hypertrophic myocytes that escaped age-related muscle atrophy and retained the proliferative response to muscle injury characteristic of younger animals. The preservation of muscle architecture and age-independent regenerative capacity through localized mIgf-1 transgene expression suggests clinical strategies for the treatment of age or disease-related muscle frailty.},

To address this issue, a novel mouse strain (Pax7-DTA) was created which enabled the conditional ablation of {\textgreater}90\% of satellite cells in mature skeletal muscle following tamoxifen administration. To test the hypothesis that satellite cells are necessary for skeletal muscle hypertrophy, the plantaris muscle of adult Pax7-DTA mice was subjected to mechanical overload by surgical removal of the synergist muscle. Following two weeks of overload, satellite cell-depleted muscle showed the same increases in muscle mass (approximately twofold) and fiber cross-sectional area with hypertrophy as observed in the vehicle-treated group. The typical increase in myonuclei with hypertrophy was absent in satellite cell-depleted fibers, resulting in expansion of the myonuclear domain. Consistent with lack of nuclear addition to enlarged fibers, long-term BrdU labeling showed a significant reduction in the number of BrdU-positive myonuclei in satellite cell-depleted muscle compared with vehicle-treated muscle. Single fiber functional analyses showed no difference in specific force, Ca2+ sensitivity, rate of cross-bridge cycling and cooperativity between hypertrophied fibers from vehicle and tamoxifen-treated groups. Although a small component of the hypertrophic response, both fiber hyperplasia and regeneration were significantly blunted following satellite cell depletion, indicating a distinct requirement for satellite cells during these processes. These results provide convincing evidence that skeletal muscle fibers are capable of mounting a robust hypertrophic response to mechanical overload that is not dependent on satellite cells.},

The different scientists have worked in this area to explore the mechanisms responsible for its pathogenesis. Anti-cancer agents activate plasma membrane localized ion channels on dorsal root ganglia and dorsal horn neurons including sodium, calcium, potassium, glutamate activated NMDA receptors to alter cytosolic ionic mileu particularly intracellular calcium that trigger secondary changes to induce neuropathic pain. These may include opening of mPTP pore on mitochondria to induce intracellular calcium release; activation of protein kinase C; phosphorylation of TRPV; activation of calpases/calpains; generation of nitric oxide and free radicals to induce cytotoxicity to axons and neuronal cell bodies. Furthermore, the inflammatory process initiated in glial cells and macrophages also trigger changes in the sensory neurons to alter nociceptive processing.

This treatment dramatically prolongs survival, even of animals in which tumor growth is not inhibited and fat loss and production of proinflammatory cytokines are not reduced. ActRIIB pathway blockade abolished the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the induction of atrophy-specific ubiquitin ligases in muscles and also markedly stimulated muscle stem cell growth. These findings establish a crucial link between activation of the ActRIIB pathway and the development of cancer cachexia.

The mechanisms underlying these changes in skeletal muscle are unknown but chemotherapy drugs used in treatment for ALL are strongly implicated. Normal skeletal muscle growth, development, and function are dependent on correctly functioning muscle satellite cells, muscle motor neurons, and muscle mitochondria. Each of these key components is potentially susceptible to damage by chemotherapy in childhood, particularly prolonged courses including repeated administration of combination chemotherapy. If this chemotherapy-induced damage is not fully reversible, impairment of satellite cells, muscle motor innervation, and mitochondria could, either singly or together, lead to the emergence of delayed or persistent skeletal muscle dysfunction many years later. The known effects of individual drugs used in the treatment of ALL are outlined and the need for specific targeted studies to investigate the mechanisms underlying persistent muscle dysfunction in survivors of ALL and other childhood cancers is highlighted.},

Although p53-deficient cancer cells are less responsive to chemotherapy, their resistance is not complete, which suggests that other apoptotic pathways may exist. A p53 -related gene, p73, which encodes several proteins as a result of alternative splicing,, can also induce apoptosis. Here we show that the amount of p73 protein in the cell is increased by cisplatin. This induction of p73 is not seen in cells unable to carry out mismatch repair and in which the nuclear enzyme c-Abl tyrosine kinase is not activated by cisplatin. The half-life of p73 is prolonged by cisplatin and by co-expression with c-Abl tyrosine kinase; the apoptosis-inducing function of p73 is also enhanced by the c-Abl kinase. Mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in mismatch repair or in c-Abl do not upregulate p73 and are more resistant to killing by cisplatin. Our results indicate that c-Abl and p73 are components of a mismatch-repair-dependent apoptosis pathway which contributes to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.},

	abstract = {The process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is generally characterized by distinct morphological characteristics and energy-dependent biochemical mechanisms. Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.},

Correlation was made with any morphological changes observed by light and electron microscopy to gain an insight into the mechanism of action of various platinum coordination complexes. CDDP in its hydrolyzed state under conditions of low chloride ion concentrations causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, calcium efflux from the mitochondria, inhibits ATP synthesis, lowers membrane-associated calcium and various membrane transport enzymes, and induces an increase in the number of lysosomes. Enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase are stripped from the brush borders of the proximal tubule cells and are discharged in the urine. However, daily IV injections of calcium (1.1 ml of 1.3\% CaCl2) supplementation protect the membrane-associated enzymes from cisplatin action. Carboplatin (CBDCA), an analogue of CDDP and the least nephrotoxic of all its analogues, shows little effect on the membrane-associated transport enzymes. Therefore, cisplatin and its various analogues seem to affect the membrane transport enzymes to varying degrees with related nephrotoxicity.

	abstract = {Cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive constituent of cannabis, is considered an antineoplastic agent on the basis of its in vitro and in vivo activity against tumor cells. However, the exact molecular mechanism through which CBD mediates this activity is yet to be elucidated. Here, we have shown CBD-induced cell death of breast cancer cells, independent of cannabinoid and vallinoid receptor activation. Electron microscopy revealed morphologies consistent with the coexistence of autophagy and apoptosis. Western blot analysis confirmed these findings. We showed that CBD induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and, subsequently, inhibits AKT and mTOR signaling as shown by decreased levels of phosphorylated mTOR and 4EBP1, and cyclin D1. Analyzing further the cross-talk between the autophagic and apoptotic signaling pathways, we found that beclin1 plays a central role in the induction of CBD-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Although CBD enhances the interaction between beclin1 and Vps34, it inhibits the association between beclin1 and Bcl-2. In addition, we showed that CBD reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, triggers the translocation of BID to the mitochondria, the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and, ultimately, the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in breast cancer cells. CBD increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS inhibition blocked the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Our study revealed an intricate interplay between apoptosis and autophagy in CBD-treated breast cancer cells and highlighted the value of continued investigation into the potential use of CBD as an antineoplastic agent.

Prompted by the observation that the [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio is subjected to dynamic fluctuations in skeletal muscle, we have tested whether Sir2 regulates muscle gene expression and differentiation. Sir2 forms a complex with the acetyltransferase PCAF and MyoD and, when overexpressed, retards muscle differentiation. Conversely, cells with decreased Sir2 differentiate prematurely. To inhibit myogenesis, Sir2 requires its NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase activity. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio decreases as muscle cells differentiate, while an increased [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio inhibits muscle gene expression. Cells with reduced Sir2 levels are less sensitive to the inhibition imposed by an elevated [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio. These results indicate that Sir2 regulates muscle gene expression and differentiation by possibly functioning as a redox sensor. In response to exercise, food intake, and starvation, Sir2 may sense modifications of the redox state and promptly modulate gene expression.},

We found that ACL is required for increases in histone acetylation in response to growth factor stimulation and during differentiation, and that glucose availability can affect histone acetylation in an ACL-dependent manner. Together, these findings suggest that ACL activity is required to link growth factor-induced increases in nutrient metabolism to the regulation of histone acetylation and gene expression.},

To study molecular regulation of satellite cells, we directly prepared satellite cells from 8- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice and performed genome-wide gene expression analysis. Compared with activated/cycling satellite cells, 507 genes were highly upregulated in quiescent satellite cells. These included negative regulators of cell cycle and myogenic inhibitors. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that quiescent satellite cells preferentially express the genes involved in cell-cell adhesion, regulation of cell growth, formation of extracellular matrix, copper and iron homeostasis, and lipid transportation. Furthermore, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on differentially expressed genes confirmed that calcitonin receptor (CTR) was exclusively expressed in dormant satellite cells but not in activated satellite cells. In addition, CTR mRNA is hardly detected in nonmyogenic cells. Therefore, we next examined the expression of CTR in vivo. CTR was specifically expressed on quiescent satellite cells, but the expression was not found on activated/proliferating satellite cells during muscle regeneration. CTR-positive cells reappeared at the rim of regenerating myofibers in later stages of muscle regeneration. Calcitonin stimulation delayed the activation of quiescent satellite cells. Our data provide roles of CTR in quiescent satellite cells and a solid scaffold to further dissect molecular regulation of satellite cells. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.},

Bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments also localize quiescent and less quiescent SCs near vessels. SCs, and to a lesser extent myonuclei, were nonrandomly associated with capillaries in humans. Significantly, they were correlated with capillarization of myofibers, regardless to their type, in normal muscle. They also varied in paradigmatic physiological and pathological situations associated with variations of capillary density, including amyopathic dermatomyositis, a unique condition in which muscle capillary loss occurs without myofiber damage, and in athletes in whom capillaries increase in number. Endothelial cell (EC) cultures specifically enhanced SC growth, through IGF-1, HGF, bFGF, PDGF-BB, and VEGF, and, accordingly, cycling SCs remained mainly juxtavascular. Conversely, differentiating myogenic cells were both proangiogenic in vitro and spatiotemporally associated with neoangiogenesis in muscular dystrophy. Thus, SCs are largely juxtavascular and reciprocally interact with ECs during differentiation to support angio-myogenesis.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of the immunosuppressive effects of glycine and its pathophysiological applications are discussed in this review. Glycine has been well characterized in spinal cord as an inhibitory neurotransmitter which activates a glycine-gated chloride channel (GlyR) expressed in postsynaptic membranes. Activation of the channel allows the influx of chloride, preventing depolarization of the plasma membrane and the potentiation of excitatory signals along the axon. Glycine has recently been shown to have similar inhibitory effects on several white blood cells, including hepatic and alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Pharmacological analysis using a GlyR antagonist strychnine, chloride-free buffer, and radiolabeled chloride has provided convincing evidence to support the hypothesis that many white blood cells contain a glycine-gated chloride channel with properties similar to the spinal cord GlyR. Molecular analysis using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting has identified the mRNA and protein for the beta subunit of the GlyR in total RNA and purified membrane protein from rat Kupffer cells. Dietary glycine is protective in rat models against endotoxemia, liver ischemia-reperfusion, and liver transplantation, most likely by inactivating the Kupffer cell via this newly identified glycine-gated chloride channel. Glycine also prevents the growth of B 16 melanomas cell in vivo. Moreover, dietary glycine is protective in the kidney against cyclosporin A toxicity and ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Given that glucose is a primary fuel source and a biosynthetic precursor, how mTORC1 signaling is coordinated with glucose metabolism has been an important question. Here, we found that the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) binds Rheb and inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Under low-glucose conditions, GAPDH prevents Rheb from binding to mTOR and thereby inhibits mTORC1 signaling. High glycolytic flux suppresses the interaction between GAPDH and Rheb and thus allows Rheb to activate mTORC1. Silencing of GAPDH or blocking of the Rheb-GAPDH interaction desensitizes mTORC1 signaling to changes in the level of glucose. The GAPDH-dependent regulation of mTORC1 in response to glucose availability occurred even in TSC1-deficient cells and AMPK-silenced cells, supporting the idea that the GAPDH-Rheb pathway functions independently of the AMPK axis. Furthermore, we show that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a glycolytic intermediate that binds GAPDH, destabilizes the Rheb-GAPDH interaction even under low-glucose conditions, explaining how high-glucose flux suppresses the interaction and activates mTORC1 signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that the glycolytic flux regulates mTOR's access to Rheb by regulating the Rheb-GAPDH interaction, thereby allowing mTORC1 to coordinate cell growth with glucose availability.},

Recent studies suggested the crucial role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the inhibition of protein synthesis and cell growth. Here, we address the role of AMPK in the regulation of muscle cell size in vitro and in vivo. The size of AMPK-deficient myotubes was 1.5-fold higher than for controls. A marked increase in p70S6K Thr(389) and rpS6 Ser-235/236 phosphorylation was observed concomitantly with an up-regulation of protein synthesis rate. Treatment with rapamycin prevented p70S6K phosphorylation and rescued cell size control in AMPK-deficient cells. Importantly, myotubes lacking AMPK were resistant to further cell size increase beyond AMPK deletion alone, as MyrAkt-induced hypertrophy was absent in these cells. Moreover, in skeletal muscle-specific deficient AMPKalpha1/alpha2 KO mice, soleus muscle showed a higher mass with myofibers of larger size and was associated with increased p70S6K and rpS6 phosphorylation. Our results uncover the role of AMPK in the maintenance of muscle cell size control and highlight the crosstalk between AMPK and mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathways coordinating a metabolic checkpoint on cell growth.},

	abstract = {The nature of the deficit underlying age-related muscle wasting remains controversial. To test whether it could be due to a poor anabolic response to dietary amino acids, we measured the rates of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in 44 healthy young and old men, of similar body build, after ingesting different amounts of essential amino acids (EAA). Basal rates of MPS were indistinguishable, but the elderly showed less anabolic sensitivity and responsiveness of MPS to EAA, possibly due to decreased intramuscular expression, and activation (phosphorylation) after EAA, of amino acid sensing/signaling proteins (mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR; p70 S6 kinase, or p70(S6k); eukaryotic initiation factor [eIF]4BP-1; and eIF2B). The effects were independent of insulin signaling since plasma insulin was clamped at basal values. Associated with the anabolic deficits were marked increases in NFkappaB, the inflammation-associated transcription factor. These results demonstrate first, EAA stimulate MPS independently of increased insulin availability; second, in the elderly, a deficit in MPS in the basal state is unlikely; and third, the decreased sensitivity and responsiveness of MPS to EAA, associated with decrements in the expression and activation of components of anabolic signaling pathways, are probably major contributors to the failure of muscle maintenance in the elderly. Countermeasures to maximize muscle maintenance should target these deficits.},

	abstract = {The relationship between mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and muscle protein synthesis during instances of amino acid surplus in humans is based solely on correlational data. Therefore, the goal of this study was to use a mechanistic approach specifically designed to determine whether increased mTORC1 activation is requisite for the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis following L-essential amino acid (EAA) ingestion in humans. Examination of muscle protein synthesis and signaling were performed on vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained from 8 young (25 ± 2 y) individuals who were studied prior to and following ingestion of 10 g of EAA during 2 separate trials in a randomized, counterbalanced design. The trials were identical except during 1 trial, participants were administered a single oral dose of a potent mTORC1 inhibitor (rapamycin) prior to EAA ingestion. In response to EAA ingestion, an {\textasciitilde}60\% increase in muscle protein synthesis was observed during the control trial, concomitant with increased phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser(2448)), ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (Thr(389)), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (Thr(37/46)). In contrast, prior administration of rapamycin completely blocked the increase in muscle protein synthesis and blocked or attenuated activation of mTORC1-signaling proteins. The inhibition of muscle protein synthesis and signaling was not due to differences in either extracellular or intracellular amino acid availability, because these variables were similar between trials. These data support a fundamental role for mTORC1 activation as a key regulator of human muscle protein synthesis in response to increased EAA availability. This information will be useful in the development of evidence-based nutritional therapies targeting mTORC1 to counteract muscle wasting associated with numerous clinical conditions.},

However, because of drug resistance and numerous undesirable side effects such as severe kidney problems, allergic reactions, decrease immunity to infections, gastrointestinal disorders, hemorrhage, and hearing loss especially in younger patients, other platinum-containing anti-cancer drugs such as carboplatin, oxaliplatin and others, have also been used. Furthermore, combination therapies of cisplatin with other drugs have been highly considered to overcome drug-resistance and reduce toxicity.

Rac1 and Cdc42 stimulate the formation of protrusive structures such as membrane ruffles, lamellipodia and filopodia. RhoA regulates contractility and assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Although prolonged integrin engagement can stimulate RhoA [3] [4] [5], regulation of this GTPase by early integrin-mediated signals is poorly understood. Here we show that integrin engagement initially inactivates RhoA, in a c-Src-dependent manner, but has no effect on Cdc42 or Rac1 activity. Additionally, early integrin signaling induces activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP via a mechanism that requires c-Src. Dynamic modulation of RhoA activity appears to have a role in motility, as both inhibition and activation of RhoA hinder migration [6] [7] [8]. Transient suppression of RhoA by integrins may alleviate contractile forces that would otherwise impede protrusion at the leading edge of migrating cells.},

Depletion of PDK1 alters the localization of ROCK1 and reduces its ability to drive cortical acto-myosin contraction. This form of ROCK1 regulation does not require PDK1 kinase activity, but instead involves direct binding of PDK1 to ROCK1 at the plasma membrane; PDK1 competes directly with RhoE for binding to ROCK1. In the absence of PDK1, negative regulation by RhoE predominates, causing reduced acto-myosin contractility and motility.

	abstract = {Epithelial–mesenchymal transitions play crucial roles in embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. It is clearly of interest to quantitatively understand the core circuitry that takes input from the cell’s environment to perform this cell-fate decision. We devised a unique model of the microRNA (miR)-based coupled chimeric modules underlying this core circuit; this effort utilizes a unique theoretical framework for treating miR dynamics. We show that the miR-200/ZEB module functions as a ternary switch, allowing not only for the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes but also for a hybrid phenotype with mixed characteristics of collective cell migration, as seen in branching morphogenesis and wound closure. Our results provide valuable clues on how to control and reverse epithelial–hybrid–mesenchymal transitions., Forward and backward transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes play crucial roles in embryonic development and tissue repair. Aberrantly regulated transitions are also a hallmark of cancer metastasis. The genetic network that regulates these transitions appears to allow for the existence of a hybrid phenotype (epithelial/mesenchymal). Hybrid cells are endowed with mixed epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, enabling specialized capabilities such as collective cell migration. Cell-fate determination between the three phenotypes is in fact regulated by a circuit composed of two highly interconnected chimeric modules—the miR-34/SNAIL and the miR-200/ZEB mutual-inhibition feedback circuits. Here, we used detailed modeling of microRNA-based regulation to study this core unit. More specifically, we investigated the functions of the two isolated modules and subsequently of the combined unit when the two modules are integrated into the full regulatory circuit. We found that miR-200/ZEB forms a tristable circuit that acts as a ternary switch, driven by miR-34/SNAIL, that is a monostable module that acts as a noise-buffering integrator of internal and external signals. We propose to associate the three stable states—(1,0), (high miR-200)/(low ZEB); (0,1), (low miR-200)/(high ZEB); and (1/2,1/2), (medium miR-200)/(medium ZEB)—with the epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrid phenotypes, respectively. Our (1/2,1/2) state hypothesis is consistent with recent experimental studies (e.g., ZEB expression measurements in collectively migrating cells) and explains the lack of observed mesenchymal-to-hybrid transitions in metastatic cells and in induced pluripotent stem cells. Testable predictions of dynamic gene expression during complete and partial transitions are presented.},

Using detailed modeling of GTPase-based regulation to study the Rac1/RhoA circuit's dynamics, we found that it can operate as a three-way switch. We propose to associate the circuit's three possible states to the amoeboid, mesenchymal and amoeboid/mesenchymal hybrid phenotype. In particular, we investigated the range of existence of, and the transition between, the three states (phenotypes) in response to Grb2 and Gab1 - two downstream adaptors of c-MET.

	volume = {111 ( Pt 7)},
	issn = {0021-9533},
	abstract = {Cell migration can be considered as a repeated cycle of membrane protrusion and attachment, cytoskeletal contraction and rear detachment. At intermediate and high levels of cell-substratum adhesiveness, cell speed appears to be rate-limited by rear detachment, specifically by the disruption of cytoskeleton-adhesion receptor-extracellular matrix (ECM) linkages. Often, cytoskeletal linkages fracture to release integrin adhesion receptors from the cell. Cell-extracellular matrix bonds may also dissociate, allowing the integrins to remain with the cell. To investigate molecular mechanisms involved in fracturing these linkages and regulating cell speed, we have developed an experimental system to track integrins during the process of rear retraction in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Integrin expression level was varied by transfecting CHO B2 cells, which express very little endogenous alpha5 integrin, with a plasmid containing human alpha5 integrin cDNA and sorting the cells into three populations with different alpha5 expression levels. Receptor/ligand affinity was varied using CHO cells transfected with either alphaIIbbeta3 or alphaIIbbeta3(beta1-2), a high affinity variant. alphaIIbbeta3(beta1-2) is activated to a higher affinity state with an anti-LIBS2 antibody. Fluorescent probes were conjugated to non-adhesion perturbing anti-integrin antibodies, which label integrins in CHO cells migrating on a matrix-coated glass coverslip. The rear retraction area was determined using phase contrast microscopy and integrins initially in this area were tracked by fluorescence microscopy and a cooled CCD camera. We find that rear retraction rate appears to limit cell speed at intermediate and high adhesiveness, but not at low adhesiveness. Upon rear retraction, the amount of integrin released from the cell increases as extracellular matrix concentration, receptor level and receptor-ligand affinity increase. In fact, integrin release is a constant function of cell-substratum adhesiveness and the number of cell-substratum bonds. In the adhesive regime where rear detachment limits the rate of cell migration, cell speed has an inverse relationship to the amount of integrin released at the rear of the cell. At high cell-substratum adhesiveness, calpain, a Ca2+-dependent protease, is also involved in release of cytoskeletal linkages during rear retraction. Inhibition of calpain results in decreased integrin release from the cell membrane, and consequently a decrease in cell speed, during migration. These observations suggest a model for rear retraction in which applied tension and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal linkage cleavage are required at high adhesiveness, but only applied tension is required at low adhesiveness.},

	abstract = {Hypercontraction or abnormal contraction of vascular smooth muscle is a major cause of diseases such as hypertension and vasospasm of the coronary and cerebral arteries. A better understanding of the mechanism of regulation of smooth muscle contraction should lead to improved treatments for such diseases. Recent studies have revealed important roles for the small GTPase Rho and its effector, Rho-associated kinase (Rho kinase) in Ca2+-independent regulation of smooth muscle contraction. The Rho–Rho-kinase pathway modulates the level of phosphorylation of the myosin light chain of myosin II, mainly through inhibition of myosin phosphatase, and contributes to agonist-induced Ca2+-sensitization in smooth muscle contraction. Rho–Rho-kinase mechanisms also participate in a variety of the cellular functions of non-muscle cells, such as stress-fibre formation, cytokinesis and cell migration. This review summarizes the role of the Rho–Rho-kinase pathway in contractile processes of smooth muscle and in non-muscle cell functions, and the pathophysiological implications of this pathway.},

The Rho-family GTPases are implicated in the signalling pathways that dictate contact initiation, maturation and turnover, but their individual roles in these processes remain to be defined.

Results: We monitored the dynamics of peripheral, Rac-induced focal complexes in living cells in response to perturbations of Rac and Rho activity and myosin contractility. We show that focal complexes formed in response to Rac differentiated into focal contacts upon upregulation of Rho. Focal complexes were dissociated by inhibitors of myosin-II-dependent contractility but not by an inhibitor of Rho-kinase. The downregulation of Rac promoted the enlargement of focal contacts, whereas a block in the Rho pathway not only caused a dissolution of focal contacts but also stimulated membrane ruffling and formation of new focal complexes, which were associated with the advance of the cell front.

Conclusions: Rac functions to signal the creation of new substrate contacts at the cell front, which are associated with the induction of ruffling lamellipodia, whereas Rho serves in the maturation of existing contacts, with both contact types requiring contractility for their formation. The transition from a focal complex to a focal contact is associated with a switch to Rho-kinase dependence. Rac and Rho also influence the development of focal contacts and focal complexes, respectively, through mutually antagonistic pathways.},

However, no effort has been made to study the PI 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] distribution in these cells. In fact, it has been suggested that PI(4,5)P2 is unlikely to localize, as its basal level is orders of magnitude higher than that of PI(3,4,5)P3. We developed an optimized immunostaining protocol for studying the endogenous distribution of PI(4,5)P2 in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. We show that PI(4,5)P2 localizes sharply at the leading edge with an intensity gradient similar to that for PI(3,4,5)P3. The enzymes for the production of PI(4,5)P2, namely, PI5KIα and PI5KIγ, were also found to localize at the leading edge, further supporting our finding that PI(4,5)P2 localizes at the leading edge.

In vivo, however, carcinoma cells frequently invade the surrounding tissue as coherent clusters or nests of cells. We have called this type of movement “cohort migration” and developed a two-dimensional in vitro cohort migration model, in which human rectal well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells (L-10) migrate from piled-up cell islands as coherent sheets of cells when stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. In this study, we examined whether there is a cohort migration-specific way of expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and whether degradation of extracellular matrix is necessary for this type of migration. Production of membrane-type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) and gelatinase A (MMP-2) by L-10 cells was demonstrated by gelatin zymography, immunoblotting, and reverse transcription-PCR. When cohort migration was induced with hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, MT1-MMP and MMP-2 were immunolocalized predominantly in the leading edges of the front cells of migrating cell sheets, with the following cells being negative. In addition, during the cohort migration on gelatin-coated substratum, the gelatin matrix was degraded by the cells, in a very organized manner, causing radially arrayed lysis of gelatin matrix at the sites of leading edges. BB94, a synthetic inhibitor specific to MMPs, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 and -2, and the COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain of MMP-2 inhibited the migration on gelatin matrix. Thus, these data demonstrate that gelatin matrix is reorganized to suit cell migration via leading-edge-of-front-cell-specific localization of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 during cohort migration and suggest that the reorganization is essential for this type of migration.},

	abstract = {Regulation of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) by different extracellular matrices (ECMs) on human endothelial cells (ECs) has been investigated. First, MT1-MMP is found at the intercellular contacts of confluent ECs grown on beta1 integrin-dependent matrix such as type 1 collagen (COL I), fibronectin (FN), or fibrinogen (FG), but not on gelatin (GEL) or vitronectin (VN). The novel localization of MT1-MMP at cell-cell contacts is assessed by confocal videomicroscopy of MT1-MMP-GFP-transfected ECs. Moreover, MT1-MMP colocalizes with beta1 integrins at the intercellular contacts, whereas it is preferentially found with alphavbeta3 integrin at motility-associated structures on migrating ECs. In addition, clustered integrins recruit MT1-MMP and neutralizing anti-beta1 or anti-alphav integrin mAb displace MT1-MMP from its specific sites, pointing to a biochemical association that is finally demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays. On the other hand, COL I, FN, or FG up-regulate cell surface MT1-MMP on confluent ECs by an impairment of its internalization, whereas expression and internalization are not modified on GEL or VN. In addition, MT1-MMP activity is diminished in confluent ECs on COL I, FN, or FG. Finally, MT1-MMP participates and cooperates with beta1 and alphavbeta3 integrins in the migration of ECs on different ECM. These data show a novel mechanism by which ECM regulates MT1-MMP association with beta1 or alphavbeta3 integrins at distinct cellular compartments, thus modulating its internalization, activity, and function on human ECs.},

Thus MMPs are able to regulate many biologic processes and are closely regulated themselves. We review recent advances that help to explain how MMPs work, how they are controlled, and how they influence biologic behavior. These advances shed light on how the structure and function of the MMPs are related and on how their transcription, secretion, activation, inhibition, localization, and clearance are controlled. MMPs participate in numerous normal and abnormal processes, and there are new insights into the key substrates and mechanisms responsible for regulating some of these processes in vivo.

To screen for members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family that mediate collagen-invasive activity, an in vitro model system was developed wherein MDCK cells were stably transfected to overexpress each of ten different MMPs that have been linked to matrix remodeling states. MDCK cells were then stimulated with scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) to initiate invasion and tubulogenesis atop either type I collagen or interstitial stroma to determine the ability of MMPs to accelerate, modify, or disrupt morphogenic responses. Neither secreted collagenases (MMP-1 and MMP-13), gelatinases (gelatinase A or B), stromelysins (MMP-3 and MMP-11), or matrilysin (MMP-7) affected SF/HGF-induced responses. By contrast, the membrane-anchored metalloproteinases, membrane-type 1 MMP, membrane-type 2 MMP, and membrane-type 3 MMP (MT1-, MT2-, and MT3-MMP) each modified the morphogenic program. Of the three MT-MMPs tested, only MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP were able to directly confer invasion-incompetent cells with the ability to penetrate type I collagen matrices. MT-MMP–dependent invasion proceeded independently of proMMP-2 activation, but required the enzymes to be membrane-anchored to the cell surface. These findings demonstrate that MT-MMP–expressing cells can penetrate and remodel type I collagen-rich tissues by using membrane-anchored metalloproteinases as pericellular collagenases.},

Beside its role during embryogenesis, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis, EphA2 kinase is frequently up-regulated in tumor cells of different histotypes, including prostate, breast, colon, and lung carcinoma, as well as melanoma. Although a function in both tumor onset and metastasis has been proposed, the role played by EphA2 is still debated. Here, we showed that EphA2 reexpression in B16 murine melanoma cells, which use a defined mesenchymal invasion strategy, converts their migration style from mesenchymal to amoeboid-like, conferring a plasticity in tumor cell invasiveness. Indeed, in response to reexpression and activation of EphA2, melanoma cells activate a nonproteolytic invasive program that proceeds through the activation of cytoskeleton motility, the retraction of cell protrusions, a Rho-mediated rounding of the cell body, and squeezing among three-dimensional matrix, giving rise to successful lung and peritoneal lymph node metastases. Our results suggest that, among the redundant mechanisms operating in tumor cells to penetrate the anatomic barriers of host tissues, EphA2 plays a pivotal role in the adaptive switch in migration pattern and mechanism, defining and distinguishing tumor cell invasion strategies.

This process, however, is only incompletely attenuated by protease inhibitor-based treatment, suggesting the existence of migratory compensation strategies. In three-dimensional collagen matrices, spindle-shaped proteolytically potent HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells exhibited a constitutive mesenchymal-type movement including the coclustering of beta 1 integrins and MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) at fiber bindings sites and the generation of tube-like proteolytic degradation tracks. Near-total inhibition of MMPs, serine proteases, cathepsins, and other proteases, however, induced a conversion toward spherical morphology at near undiminished migration rates. Sustained protease-independent migration resulted from a flexible amoeba-like shape change, i.e., propulsive squeezing through preexisting matrix gaps and formation of constriction rings in the absence of matrix degradation, concomitant loss of clustered beta 1 integrins and MT1-MMP from fiber binding sites, and a diffuse cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. Acquisition of protease-independent amoeboid dissemination was confirmed for HT-1080 cells injected into the mouse dermis monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy. In conclusion, the transition from proteolytic mesenchymal toward nonproteolytic amoeboid movement highlights a supramolecular plasticity mechanism in cell migration and further represents a putative escape mechanism in tumor cell dissemination after abrogation of pericellular proteolysis.},

Gradients of either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) stimulate collection into microneedles of tumor cells and macrophages even though tumor cells express only EGF receptor and macrophages express only CSF-1 receptor. Intravital imaging shows that macrophages and tumor cells migrate toward microneedles containing either EGF or CSF-1. Inhibition of either CSF-1– or EGF-stimulated signaling reduces the migration of both cell types.

Notably, the expression and subcellular localization of epithelial markers are unaltered, and mesenchymal markers are not induced in invasive podoplanin-expressing tumor cells. Rather, podoplanin induces collective cell migration by filopodia formation via the downregulation of the activities of small Rho family GTPases. In conclusion, podoplanin induces an alternative pathway of tumor cell invasion in the absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).},

	abstract = {Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is common in most sporadic and inherited colorectal cancer (CRC) cells leading to elevated β-catenin/TCF transactivation. We previously identified the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 as a target gene of β-catenin/TCF in CRC cells. Forced expression of L1 confers increased cell motility, invasion, and tumorigenesis, and the induction of human CRC cell metastasis to the liver. In human CRC tissue, L1 is exclusively localized at the invasive front of such tumors in a subpopulation of cells displaying nuclear β-catenin. We determined whether L1 expression confers metastatic capacities by inducing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and whether L1 cosegregates with cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. We found that changes in L1 levels do not affect the organization or expression of E-cadherin in cell lines, or in invading CRC tissue cells, and no changes in other epithelial or mesenchymal markers were detected after L1 transfection. The introduction of major EMT regulators (Slug and Twist) into CRC cell lines reduced the levels of E-cadherin and induced fibronectin and vimentin, but unlike L1, Slug and Twist expression was insufficient for conferring metastasis. In CRC cells L1 did not specifically cosegregate with CSC markers including CD133, CD44, and EpCAM. L1-mediated metastasis required NF-κB signaling in cells harboring either high or low levels of endogenous E-cadherin. The results suggest that L1-mediated metastasis of CRC cells does not require changes in EMT and CSC markers and operates by activating NF-κβ signaling.},

Application of protein surface analysis and energy calculations to all known chemokine structures leads to the proposal that four different binding modes are created by the folding and oligomerization of these proteins. So, based on the present state of our knowledge, four different clusters of amino acids should be involved in the recognition process.

We cultured National Institutes of Health 3T3 fibroblasts on flexible polyacrylamide sheets coated with type I collagen. A transition in rigidity was introduced in the central region of the sheet by a discontinuity in the concentration of the bis-acrylamide cross-linker. Cells approaching the transition region from the soft side could easily migrate across the boundary, with a concurrent increase in spreading area and traction forces. In contrast, cells migrating from the stiff side turned around or retracted as they reached the boundary. We call this apparent preference for a stiff substrate "durotaxis." In addition to substrate rigidity, we discovered that cell movement could also be guided by manipulating the flexible substrate to produce mechanical strains in the front or rear of a polarized cell. We conclude that changes in tissue rigidity and strain could play an important controlling role in a number of normal and pathological processes involving cell locomotion.},

Tumor cell metastasis is facilitated by “pre-metastatic niches” formed in destination organs by invading bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs). Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is critical for pre-metastatic niche formation. LOX secreted by hypoxic breast tumor cells accumulates at pre-metastatic sites, cross-links collagen-IV in the basement membrane, and is essential for CD11b+ myeloid cell recruitment. CD11b+ cells adhere to cross-linked collagen-IV and produce matrix metalloproteinase-2 which cleaves collagen, enhancing the invasion and recruitment of BMDCs and metastasizing tumor cells. LOX inhibition prevents CD11b+ cell recruitment and metastatic growth. CD11b+ cells and LOX also co-localize in biopsies of human metastases. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for LOX in pre-metastatic niche formation and support targeting LOX for the treatment and prevention of metastatic disease.},

We show here that MMP-2 expression was upregulated in OvCa cells upon attachment to their microenvironment. Downregulation of MMP-2 mRNA or pharmacological inhibition of MMP-2 proteolytic function, in both human OvCa primary cells and cell lines, reduced attachment of OvCa cells to a 3D organotypic model of metastatic OvCa, full human omentum or peritoneum, and in vivo to mouse peritoneum and omentum. Absence of MMP-2 in the host did not alter OvCa adhesion, as determined utilizing mice harboring homozygous null mutations in either the Mmp2 or Mmp9 genes. Conversely, adhesion induced upregulation of MMP-2 mRNA in OvCa cells. MMP-2 inhibition in OvCa cells through pharmacological or antibody treatment prior to i.p. dissemination in nude mice significantly decreased tumor growth and metastasis and extended survival. MMP-2 enhanced peritoneal adhesion of OvCa cells through cleavage of ECM proteins fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (Vn) into small fragments and increased binding of OvCa cells to these FN and Vn fragments and their receptors, α5β1 and αVβ3 integrin. These findings indicate that MMP-2 expressed by metastatic OvCa cells functionally regulates their attachment to peritoneal surfaces.},

	abstract = {The L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) plays a major role in the development of the nervous system and in the malignancy of human tumors. In terms of biological function, L1CAM comes along in two different flavors: (1) a static function as a cell adhesion molecule that acts as a glue between cells; (2) a motility promoting function that drives cell migration during neural development and supports metastasis of human cancers. Important factors that contribute to the switch in the functional mode of L1CAM are: (1) the cleavage from the cell surface by membrane proximal proteolysis and (2) the ability to change binding partners and engage in L1CAM-integrin binding. Recent studies have shown that the cleavage of L1CAM by metalloproteinases and the binding of L1CAM to integrins via its RGD-motif in the sixth Ig-domain activate signaling pathways distinct from the ones elicited by homophilic binding. Here we highlight important features of L1CAM proteolysis and the signaling of L1CAM via integrin engagement. The novel insights into L1CAM downstream signaling and its regulation during tumor progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) will lead to a better understanding of the dualistic role of L1CAM as a cell adhesion and/or motility promoting cell surface molecule.},

However, it remains unclear whether E-cadherin and nectins up-regulate, maintain or suppress Rac1 activity during cell-cell adhesion. Roles for Rho GTPases are complicated by cell spreading and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix that occur concurrently with cell-cell adhesion, and which also require Rho GTPases. Here, we designed a simple approach to examine Rac1 activity upon cell-cell adhesion by MDCK epithelial cells, without cell spreading or integrin-based adhesion. Upon initiation of cell-cell contact in 3-D cell aggregates, we observed an initial peak of Rac1 activity that rapidly decreased by ∼66\% within 5 minutes, and further decreased to a low baseline level after 30 minutes. Inhibition of E-cadherin engagement with DECMA-1 Fab fragments or competitive binding of soluble E-cadherin, or nectin2alpha extracellular domain completely inhibited Rac1 activity. These results indicate that cadherins and nectins cooperate to induce and then rapidly suppress Rac1 activity during initial cell-cell adhesion, which may be important in inhibiting the migratory cell phenotype and allowing the establishment of initially weak cell-cell adhesions.},

The contribution of the cadherin–catenin complex to the interaction between actin and the adherens junction remains an intensely investigated subject that centres on the function of α-catenin, which binds to cadherin through β-catenin and can bind F-actin directly or indirectly. Here, we delineate regions within Drosophila α-Catenin (α-Cat) that are important for adherens junction performance in static epithelia and dynamic morphogenetic processes. Moreover, we address whether persistent α-catenin-mediated physical linkage between cadherin and F-actin is crucial for cell adhesion and characterize the functions of α-catenin monomers and dimers at adherens junctions. Our data support the view that monomeric α-catenin acts as an essential physical linker between the cadherin–β-catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton, whereas α-catenin dimers are cytoplasmic and form an equilibrium with monomeric junctional α-catenin.},

	abstract = {Podoplanin is a small membrane mucin expressed in tumors associated with malignant progression. It is enriched at cell-surface protrusions where it colocalizes with members of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family. Here, we found that human podoplanin directly interacts with ezrin (and moesin) in vitro and in vivo through a cluster of basic amino acids within its cytoplasmic tail, mainly through a juxtamembrane dipeptide RK. Podoplanin induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in MDCK cells linked to the activation of RhoA and increased cell migration and invasiveness. Fluorescence time-lapse video observations in migrating cells indicate that podoplanin might be involved in ruffling activity as well as in retractive processes. By using mutant podoplanin constructs fused to green fluorescent protein we show that association of the cytoplasmic tail with ERM proteins is required for upregulation of RhoA activity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, expression of either a dominant-negative truncated variant of ezrin or a dominant-negative mutant form of RhoA blocked podoplanin-induced RhoA activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results provide a mechanistic basis to understand the role of podoplanin in cell migration or invasiveness.},

Collective movement requires cells to retain cell-cell contacts, exhibit group polarization with defined front-rear asymmetry, and consequently move as one multicellular unit. Depending on the cell type, morphology of the group and the tissue context, distinct mechanisms control the leading edge dynamics and guidance. Leading edge migration may either result from adhesion to ECM and contractile pulling, or from forward pushing. The leading edge consists of either one or few dedicated tip cells or a multicellular leading row that generate adhesion and traction towards the tissue substrate. Alternatively, a multicellular bud consisting of many cells protrudes collectively by proliferation and growth thereby mechanically expanding and pushing towards the tissue stroma. Each type of collective guidance engages distinct spatiotemporal molecular control and feedback towards rearward cells and the adjacent tissue microenvironment; these include intrinsic polarity mechanisms regulated by the interplay between cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions; or the heterotypic integration of stromal cells that adopt leader cell functions.

Upon long-term migration within 3-dimensional collagen matrices, however, no in situ collagenolysis was obtained by sensitive fluorescein isothiocyanate-collagen fragmentation analysis and confocal fluorescence/backscatter microscopy. Consistent with nonproteolytic migration, T-cell crawling and path generation were not impaired by protease inhibitor cocktail targeting MMPs, serine proteases, cysteine proteases, and cathepsins. Dynamic imaging of cell-ECM interactions showed T-cell migration as an amoeba-like process driven by adaptive morphology, crawling along collagen fibrils (contact guidance) and squeezing through pre-existing matrix gaps by vigorous shape change. The concept of nonproteolytic amoeboid migration was confirmed for multicomponent collagen lattices containing hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate and for other migrating leukocytes including CD8+ T blasts, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and U937 monocytic cells.

Within the cell sheet there arise unanticipated fluctuations of mechanical stress that are severe, emerge spontaneously, and ripple across the monolayer. This stress landscape becomes increasingly rugged, sluggish, and cooperative with increasing system density. Within that landscape, local cellular migrations follow local orientations of maximal principal stress. Migrations of both endothelial and epithelial monolayers conform to this behavior, as do breast cancer cell lines before but not after the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Accumulation of phospho-MLC and blebbing activity were restricted to the uropod as reporters of actomyosin contractility, and velocimetric analysis of fluorescent beads embedded within the 3D matrix showed that pulling forces exerted to the matrix are restricted to the side and rear of cells. Inhibition of actomyosin contractility or β1 integrin function interferes with uropod formation, matrix deformation, and invasion through Matrigel. These findings support a model whereby actomyosin-based uropod contractility generates traction forces on the β1 integrin adhesion system to drive cell propulsion within the 3D matrix, with no contribution of lamellipodia extension or blebbing to movement.},

During blebbing, the membrane detaches from the cortex and inflates. As expansion ceases, contractile cortex reassembles under the membrane and drives bleb retraction. This cycle enabled us to measure the temporal sequence of protein recruitment to the membrane during cortex reassembly and to explore dependency relationships. Expanding blebs were devoid of actin, but proteins of the erythrocytic submembranous cytoskeleton were present. When expansion ceased, ezrin was recruited to the membrane first, followed by actin, actin-bundling proteins, and, finally, contractile proteins. Complete assembly of the contractile cortex, which was organized into a cagelike mesh of filaments, took ∼30 s. Cytochalasin D blocked recruitment of actin and α-actinin, but had no effect on membrane association of ankyrin B and ezrin. Ezrin played no role in actin nucleation, but was essential for tethering the membrane to the cortex. The Rho pathway was important for cortex assembly in blebs.},

	abstract = {Adhesion of tumor cells to host cell layers and subsequent migration are pivotal steps in cancer invasion and metastasis. The small GTP-binding protein RhoA controls cell adhesion and motility through organization of the actin cytoskeleton and regulation of actomyosin contractility. Cultured rat MM1 hepatoma cells migrate through a mesothelial cell monolayer in vitro in a serum-dependent, RhoA-mediated manner (K. Yoshioka et al., J. Biol. Chem., 273: 5146–5154, 1998). Furthermore, the ROCK family of RhoA-associated serine-threonine protein kinases is involved in this migration, and an inhibitor for these kinases effectively inhibits the invasion of MM1 cells in vitro and in vivo (K. Itoh et al., Nat. Med., 5: 221–225, 1999). Although there have been no reports of genetic alterations directly affecting RhoA in human cancer, the expression level of RhoA in tumors has been several times higher than that of surrounding normal tissue; RhoA was especially highly expressed in the metastatic region. To determine whether RhoA is activated by its overexpression, we made stable transfectants of MM1 cells expressing various levels of wild-type human RhoA. These transfectants showed promoted invasive ability in vitro in the absence and presence of 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid, marked adherence to the plastic culture dish with scattered shape, elevated phosphorylation of Mr 20,000 myosin light chain, and translocation of RhoA protein from the cytosol to the membrane. All of these phenotypes were similar to those of active RhoA transfectants, correlated with the expression level of RhoA and reversed by the treatment of the cells with Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase. In addition, overexpression of wild-type RhoA in MM1 cells also conferred invasive ability in vivo after the cells were transplanted into the syngeneic rats. Thus, high expression of RhoA in the cell facilitates the translocation of this protein to the membrane, where it is activated, resulting in the stimulation of the RhoA-ROCK-actomyosin system, leading to invasion.},

Basic steps involved in cell migration have been defined for two-dimensional haptokinetic migration which, however, does not provide physical constraints imposed by three-dimensional interstitial tissues. We here describe the process of pericellular proteolysis that leads to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and realignment during cell movement and integrate it into established steps of cell migration. After actin-driven leading edge protrusion (step I) and anterior formation of integrin-mediated focal interactions to the substrate (step II), ECM breakdown is focalized towards physical ECM barriers several micrometer rearward of the leading edge (step III). Actomyosin-mediated cell contraction (step IV) then leads to rear-end retraction and forward sliding of cell body and nucleus so that a small tube-like matrix defect bordered by realigned ECM fibers becomes apparent (step V). Pericellular proteolysis is thus integral to the migration cycle and serves to widen ECM gaps and thereby lowers physical stress upon the cell body, which ultimately leads to aligned higher-oder ECM patterns.},

	abstract = {The three-step model of cell migration consisting of protrusion of a leading lamella, attachment to the substrate, and contraction of the cell body is well established for fibroblasts migrating across planar surfaces. However, it is not resolved to what extent the migration of cancer cells in a 3-dimensional tissue environment follows similar principles. Here, we present evidence that the migration of highly invasive MV3 melanoma cells in 3-dimensional collagen matrices follows the three-step concept of migration but also results in characteristic reorganization of the extracellular matrix. After incorporation in the lattice, MV3 cells spontaneously developed a slow type of migration (mean velocity, 0.19 microm/min), leading to alignment of collagen fibers at attachment sites, as detected from unfixed and fixed samples by confocal reflection contrast in combination with immunofluorescence staining. In the process of migration, the formation of focal clusters or stripes of alpha2 and beta1 integrins colocalized with binding sites to collagen fibrils at the leading as well as the trailing edge. In contrast, CD44 was nonclustered and redistributed toward the rear end of the cell. At detachment sites, dynamic fiber traction, localized fiber disruption, and the release of cell surface determinants, including alpha2beta1 integrins and CD44, resulted in circumscribed matrix reorganization. Not infrequently, these emerging tube-like paths of least resistance bordered by a dense fiber network facilitated the reorientation and contact guidance of proximate MV3 cells to migrate along the preexisting path. In conclusion, the migration of MV3 cells in 3-dimensional collagen lattices resulted in dynamic tissue reorganization and receptor shedding the consequences of which were directly visualized by combining confocal reflection imaging with immunofluorescence.},

Here we demonstrate that integrin-mediated adhesion to high fibronectin concentrations induces a stop signal for cell migration by inhibiting cell polarization and protrusion. On fibronectin, the stop signal is generated through alpha 5 beta 1 integrin-mediated signaling to the Rho family of GTPases. Specifically, Cdc42 and Rac1 activation exhibits a biphasic dependence on fibronectin concentration that parallels optimum cell polarization and protrusion. In contrast, RhoA activity increases with increasing substratum concentration. We find that cross talk between Cdc42 and Rac1 is required for substratum-stimulated protrusion, whereas RhoA activity is inhibitory. We also show that Cdc42 activity is inhibited by Rac1 activation, suggesting that Rac1 activity may down-regulate Cdc42 activity and promote the formation of stabilized rather than transient protrusion. Furthermore, expression of RhoA down-regulates Cdc42 and Rac1 activity, providing a mechanism whereby RhoA may inhibit cell polarization and protrusion. These findings implicate adhesion-dependent signaling as a mechanism to stop cell migration by regulating cell polarity and protrusion via the Rho family of GTPases.},

These intrinsic molecular programs are associated with a characteristic structure of the actin cytoskeleton, as well as the cell-type-specific use of integrins, matrix-degrading enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteases), cell–cell adhesion molecules (cadherins and activated leukocyte adhesion molecule), and signaling towards the cytoskeleton (carried out by RHO GTPases). In response to the gain or loss of these key molecular determinants, significant adaptation reactions can modify the cell’s shape, pattern, and migration mechanism; examples of this include the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, mesenchymal–amoeboid transition and collective–amoeboid transition.},

We find that the expression of TNC, an extracellular matrix protein of stem cell niches, is associated with the aggressiveness of pulmonary metastasis. Cancer cell-derived TNC promotes the survival and outgrowth of pulmonary micrometastases. TNC enhances the expression of stem cell signaling components, musashi homolog 1 (MSI1) and leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5). MSI1 is a positive regulator of NOTCH signaling, whereas LGR5 is a target gene of the WNT pathway. TNC modulation of stem cell signaling occurs without affecting the expression of transcriptional enforcers of the stem cell phenotype and pluripotency, namely nanog homeobox (NANOG), POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1), also known as OCT4, and SRY-box 2 (SOX2). TNC protects MSI1-dependent NOTCH signaling from inhibition by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), and selectively enhances the expression of LGR5 as a WNT target gene. Cancer cell-derived TNC remains essential for metastasis outgrowth until the tumor stroma takes over as a source of TNC. These findings link TNC to pathways that support the fitness of metastasis-initiating breast cancer cells and highlight the relevance of TNC as an extracellular matrix component of the metastatic niche.},

Here we identify a role for the transcriptional inhibitors of differentiation Id1 and Id3 as selective mediators of lung metastatic colonization in the triple negative [TN, i.e., lacking expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and lacking Her2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) amplification] subgroup of human breast cancer. Although broad expression of Id1 has recently been documented in tumors of the rare metaplastic subtype, here we report that rare Id1-expressing cells are also present in the more common TN subset of human breast tumors but not in other subtypes. We also provide evidence that Id1 expression is enriched in clinically obtained hormone receptor negative lung metastases. Functional studies demonstrate that Id1 and its closely related family member Id3 are required for tumor initiating functions, both in the context of primary tumor formation and during metastatic colonization of the lung microenvironment. In vivo characterization of lung metastatic progression reveals that Id1 and Id3 facilitate sustained proliferation during the early stages of metastatic colonization, subsequent to extravasation into the lung parenchyma. These results shed light on the proliferative mechanisms that initiate metastatic colonization, and they implicate Id1 and Id3 as mediators of this malignant function in the TN subgroup of breast cancers.},

We show here that intravenously injected, nonmetastatic cancer cells cease proliferating after extravasating into the parenchyma of the lungs; this response is attributable to the cells inability to trigger adhesion-related signaling events when they are scattered sparsely within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the parenchyma. We recapitulate this situation by culturing these nonmetastatic cells at low seeding density in ECM-derived gels in vitro, in which they undergo cell-cycle arrest resulting, in part, from insufficient activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Metastatic cancer cells, in contrast, show sufficient FAK activation to enable their proliferation within ECM gels in vitro and continue cell-cycle progression within the lung parenchyma in vivo. Activation of FAK in these metastatic cells depends on expression of the beta(1) subunit of integrins, and proliferation of these cells after extravasation in the lungs is diminished by knocking down the expression of either FAK or integrin beta(1). These results demonstrate the critical role of integrin beta(1)-FAK signaling axis in controlling the initial proliferation of micrometastatic cancer cells disseminated in the lungs.},

Based on clinical, functional and molecular evidence, we show that the cytokine TGFβ in the breast tumor microenvironment primes cancer cells for metastasis to the lungs. Central to this process is the induction of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) by TGFβ via the Smad signaling pathway. TGFβ induction of ANGPTL4 in cancer cells that are about to enter the circulation enhances their subsequent retention in the lungs, but not in the bone. Tumor cell-derived ANGPTL4 disrupts vascular endothelial cell-cell junctions, increases the permeability of lung capillaries, and facilitates the trans-endothelial passage of tumor cells. These results suggest a mechanism for metastasis whereby a cytokine in the primary tumor microenvironment induces the expression of another cytokine in departing tumor cells, empowering these cells to disrupt lung capillary walls and seed pulmonary metastases.},

Metastatic tumor cells attached to the endothelia of pulmonary pre-capillary arterioles and capillaries. Extravasation of tumor cells was rare, and it seemed that the transmigrated cells were cleared quickly by the lung, leaving only the endothelium-attached cells as the seeds of secondary tumors. Early colonies were entirely within the blood vessels. Although most models of metastasis include an extravasation step early in the process, here we show that in the lung, metastasis is initiated by attachment of tumor cells to the vascular endothelium and that hematogenous metastasis originates from the proliferation of attached intravascular tumor cells rather than from extravasated ones. Intravascular metastasis formation would make early colonies especially vulnerable to intravascular drugs, and this possibility has potential for the prevention of tumor cell attachment to the endothelium.},

By monitoring the localization of Smad2 and the activity of a TGFbeta-dependent reporter gene during breast cancer cell dissemination, we demonstrate that TGFbeta signalling is transiently and locally activated in motile single cells. TGFbeta1 switches cells from cohesive to single cell motility through a transcriptional program involving Smad4, EGFR, Nedd9, M-RIP, FARP and RhoC. Blockade of TGFbeta signalling prevented cells moving singly in vivo but did not inhibit cells moving collectively. Cells restricted to collective invasion were capable of lymphatic invasion but not blood-borne metastasis. Constitutive TGFbeta signalling promoted single cell motility and intravasation but reduced subsequent growth in the lungs.

Overexpression of miR-31 in otherwise-aggressive breast tumor cells suppresses metastasis. We deploy a stable microRNA sponge strategy to inhibit miR-31 in vivo; this allows otherwise-nonaggressive breast cancer cells to metastasize. These phenotypes do not involve confounding influences on primary tumor development and are specifically attributable to miR-31-mediated inhibition of several steps of metastasis, including local invasion, extravasation or initial survival at a distant site, and metastatic colonization. Such pleiotropy is achieved via coordinate repression of a cohort of metastasis-promoting genes, including RhoA. Indeed, RhoA re-expression partially reverses miR-31-imposed metastasis suppression. These findings indicate that miR-31 uses multiple mechanisms to oppose metastasis.},

In particular, the genes coding for the minimum motility machine that regulates beta-actin polymerization at the leading edge and, therefore, the motility and chemotaxis of carcinoma cells, were dramatically up-regulated. However, ZBP1, which restricts the localization of beta-actin, the substrate for the minimum motility machine, was down-regulated. This pattern of expression implicated ZBP1 as a suppressor of invasion. Reexpression of ZBP1 in metastatic cells with otherwise low levels of ZBP1 reestablished normal patterns of beta-actin mRNA targeting and suppressed chemotaxis and invasion in primary tumors. ZBP1 reexpression also inhibited metastasis from tumors. These experiments support the involvement in metastasis of the pathways identified in invasive cells, which are regulated by ZBP1.},

	abstract = {Cell migration in extracellular matrix is a complex process of adhesion and deadhesion events combined with cellular strategies to overcome the biophysical resistance imposed by three-dimensionally interconnected matrix ligands. Using a 3-D collagen matrix migration model in combination with computer-assisted cell tracking for reconstruction of migration paths and confocal microscopy, we investigated molecular principles governing cell-matrix interactions and migration of different cell types. Highly invasive MV3 melanoma cells and fibroblasts are large and highly polarized cells migrating at low speed (0.1-0.5 microm/min) and at high directional persistence. MV3 melanoma cells utilize adhesive migration strategies as characterized by high beta1 integrin surface expression, beta1 integrin clustering at interactions with matrix fibers, and beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion for force generation and migration. In contrast, T lymphocytes and dendritic cells are highly mobile cells of lower beta1 integrin expression migrating at 10- to 40-fold higher velocities, and directionally unpredictable path profiles. This migration occurs in the absence of focal adhesions and largely independent of beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion. Whereas cell-matrix interactions of migrating tumor cells result in traction and reorientation of collagen fibers, partial matrix degradation, and pore formation, leukocytes form transient and short-lived interactions with the collagen lacking structural proteolysis and matrix remodeling. In conclusion, the 3-D extracellular matrix provides a spatially complex and biomechanically demanding substrate for cell migration, thereby differing from cell migration across planar ligands. Highly adhesive and integrin-dependent migration strategies detected in morphologically large and slowly migrating cells may result in reorganization of the extracellular matrix, whereas leukocytes favor largely integrin-independent, rapid, and flexible migration strategies lacking typical focal adhesions and structural matrix remodeling.},

In 3D collagen, PIP3 and active Rac1 and Cdc42 were targeted to the leading edge, consistent with lamellipodia-based migration. In contrast, elongated cells migrating inside dermal explants and the cell-derived matrix (CDM) formed blunt, cylindrical protrusions, termed lobopodia, and Rac1, Cdc42, and PIP3 signaling was nonpolarized. Reducing RhoA, Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), or myosin II activity switched the cells to lamellipodia-based 3D migration. These modes of 3D migration were regulated by matrix physical properties. Specifically, experimentally modifying the elasticity of the CDM or collagen gels established that nonlinear elasticity supported lamellipodia-based migration, whereas linear elasticity switched cells to lobopodia-based migration. Thus, the relative polarization of intracellular signaling identifies two distinct modes of 3D cell migration governed intrinsically by RhoA, ROCK, and myosin II and extrinsically by the elastic behavior of the 3D extracellular matrix.},

Using time-resolved multimodal microscopy, we show how invasive HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells coordinate mechanotransduction and fibrillar collagen remodelling by segregating the anterior force-generating leading edge containing beta1 integrin, MT1-MMP and F-actin from a posterior proteolytic zone executing fibre breakdown. During forward movement, sterically impeding fibres are selectively realigned into microtracks of single-cell calibre. Microtracks become expanded by multiple following cells by means of the large-scale degradation of lateral ECM interfaces, ultimately prompting transition towards collective invasion similar to that in vivo. Both ECM track widening and transition to multicellular invasion are dependent on MT1-MMP-mediated collagenolysis, shown by broad-spectrum protease inhibition and RNA interference. Thus, invasive migration and proteolytic ECM remodelling are interdependent processes that control tissue micropatterning and macropatterning and, consequently, individual and collective cell migration.},

	abstract = {Background
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive disease associated with poor survival. It is essential to account for the complexity of GBM biology to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This complexity is best represented by the increasing amounts of profiling (“omics”) data available due to advances in biotechnology. The challenge of integrating these vast genomic and proteomic data can be addressed by a comprehensive systems modeling approach.

Methods
Here, we present an in silico model, where we simulate GBM tumor cells using genomic profiling data. We use this in silico tumor model to predict responses of cancer cells to targeted drugs. Initially, we probed the results from a recent hypothesis-independent, empirical study by Garnett and co-workers that analyzed the sensitivity of hundreds of profiled cancer cell lines to 130 different anticancer agents. We then used the tumor model to predict sensitivity of patient-derived GBM cell lines to different targeted therapeutic agents.

Results
Among the drug-mutation associations reported in the Garnett study, our in silico model accurately predicted {\textasciitilde}85\% of the associations. While testing the model in a prospective manner using simulations of patient-derived GBM cell lines, we compared our simulation predictions with experimental data using the same cells in vitro. This analysis yielded a {\textasciitilde}75\% agreement of in silico drug sensitivity with in vitro experimental findings.

Conclusions
These results demonstrate a strong predictability of our simulation approach using the in silico tumor model presented here. Our ultimate goal is to use this model to stratify patients for clinical trials. By accurately predicting responses of cancer cells to targeted agents a priori, this in silico tumor model provides an innovative approach to personalizing therapy and promises to improve clinical management of cancer.},

In STAP, strong external stimuli such as a transient low-pH stressor reprogrammed mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells. Through real-time imaging of STAP cells derived from purified lymphocytes, as well as gene rearrangement analysis, we found that committed somatic cells give rise to STAP cells by reprogramming rather than selection. STAP cells showed a substantial decrease in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of pluripotency marker genes. Blastocyst injection showed that STAP cells efficiently contribute to chimaeric embryos and to offspring via germline transmission. We also demonstrate the derivation of robustly expandable pluripotent cell lines from STAP cells. Thus, our findings indicate that epigenetic fate determination of mammalian cells can be markedly converted in a context-dependent manner by strong environmental cues.},

	abstract = {Drug resistance presents a challenge to the treatment of cancer patients. Many studies have focused on cell-autonomous mechanisms of drug resistance. By contrast, we proposed that the tumour micro-environment confers innate resistance to therapy. Here we developed a co-culture system to systematically assay the ability of 23 stromal cell types to influence the innate resistance of 45 cancer cell lines to 35 anticancer drugs. We found that stroma-mediated resistance is common, particularly to targeted agents. We characterized further the stroma-mediated resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to RAF inhibitors because most patients with this type of cancer show some degree of innate resistance. Proteomic analysis showed that stromal cell secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) resulted in activation of the HGF receptor MET, reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-AKT signalling pathways, and immediate resistance to RAF inhibition. Immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed stromal cell expression of HGF in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma and showed a significant correlation between HGF expression by stromal cells and innate resistance to RAF inhibitor treatment. Dual inhibition of RAF and either HGF or MET resulted in reversal of drug resistance, suggesting RAF plus HGF or MET inhibitory combination therapy as a potential therapeutic strategy for BRAF-mutant melanoma. A similar resistance mechanism was uncovered in a subset of BRAF-mutant colorectal and glioblastoma cell lines. More generally, this study indicates that the systematic dissection of interactions between tumours and their micro-environment can uncover important mechanisms underlying drug resistance.},

However, identification of the eYFP+ subpopulations has remained sketchy and fragmentary even for the most widely used lines such as Thy1-eYFP-H mice (Feng, G., Mellor, R.H., Bernstein, M., Keller-Peck, C., Nguyen, Q.T., Wallace, M., Nerbonne, J.M., Lichtman and J.W., Sanes.

Here, we provide a comprehensive mapping of labeled cell types throughout the central nervous system in adult and postnatal (P0-P30) Thy1-eYFP-H mice. Cell type identification was based on somatodendritic morphology, axon trajectories, and, for cortical cells, retrograde labeling with Fast Blue to distinguish between subpopulations with different axonal targets. In the neocortex, eYFP+ cells are layers 5 and 6 pyramidal neurons, whose abundance and sublaminar distribution varies markedly between areas. Labeling is particularly prevalent in the corticospinal cells; as a result, the pyramidal pathway axons are conspicuously labeled down to the spinal cord. Large populations of hippocampal, subicular and amygdaloid projection neurons are eYFP+ as well. Additional eYFP+ cell groups are located in specific brainstem nuclei. Present results provide a comprehensive reference dataset for adult and developmental studies using the Thy1-eYFP-H mice strain, and show that this animal model may be particularly suitable for studies on the cell biology of corticospinal neurons.},

SPP involves macro-dissecting tumors, flow-sorting genomic subpopulations by DNA content, and profiling genomes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Breast carcinomas display two classes of genomic structural variation: (1) monogenomic and (2) polygenomic. Monogenomic tumors appear to contain a single major clonal subpopulation with a highly stable chromosome structure. Polygenomic tumors contain multiple clonal tumor subpopulations, which may occupy the same sectors, or separate anatomic locations. In polygenomic tumors, we show that heterogeneity can be ascribed to a few clonal subpopulations, rather than a series of gradual intermediates.

Spontaneous chromosome mis-segregation events in aneuploid cells promote Chromosomal Instability (CIN) that may contribute to the acquisition of multi-drug resistance in vitro and heighten risk for tumour relapse in animal models. Identification of distinct therapeutic agents that target tumour karyotypic complexity has important clinical implications. In order to identify distinct therapeutic approaches to specifically limit the growth of CIN tumours we focussed on a panel of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, previously classified as either chromosomally-unstable (CIN+) or diploid/near-diploid (CIN−), and treated them individually with a library of kinase inhibitors targeting components of signal transduction, cell cycle and trans-membrane receptor signalling pathways. CIN+ cell lines displayed significant intrinsic multi-drug resistance compared to CIN− cancer cell lines and this appeared to be independent of somatic mutation status and proliferation rate. Confirming the association of CIN rather than ploidy status with multi-drug resistance, tetraploid isogenic cells that had arisen from diploid cell lines displayed lower drug sensitivity than their diploid parental cells only with increasing chromosomal heterogeneity, and isogenic cell line models of CIN+ displayed multi-drug resistance relative to their CIN− parental cancer cell line derivatives. In a meta-analysis of CRC outcome following cytotoxic treatment, CIN+ predicted worse progression-free or disease-free survival relative to patients with CIN− disease. Our results suggest that stratifying tumour responses according to CIN status should be considered within the context of clinical trials to minimize the confounding effects of tumour CIN status on drug sensitivity.},

Recently developed massively parallel sequencing platforms promise the ability to detect rare subclones of genetic variants without a priori knowledge of the mutations involved. We used ultra-deep pyrosequencing to investigate intraclonal diversification at the Ig heavy chain locus in 22 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Analysis of a non-polymorphic control locus revealed artifactual insertions and deletions resulting from sequencing errors and base substitutions caused by polymerase misincorporation during PCR amplification. We developed an algorithm to differentiate genuine haplotypes of somatic hypermutations from such artifacts. This proved capable of detecting multiple rare subclones with frequencies as low as 1 in 5000 copies and allowed the characterization of phylogenetic interrelationships among subclones within each patient. This study demonstrates the potential for ultra-deep resequencing to recapitulate the dynamics of clonal evolution in cancer cell populations.},

Modification of the methylation state of these lysine residues of histone H3 regulates chromatin structure and is implicated in transcriptional control. However, together these mutations are present in fewer than 15\% of ccRCC, suggesting the existence of additional, currently unidentified cancer genes. Here, we have sequenced the protein coding exome in a series of primary ccRCC and report the identification of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex gene PBRM1 as a second major ccRCC cancer gene, with truncating mutations in 41\% (92/227) of cases.

	abstract = {There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100\% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.},
