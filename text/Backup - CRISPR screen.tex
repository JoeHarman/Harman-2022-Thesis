\subsubsection{MLL-AF4 and RUNX1 cooperate to regulate apoptosis, and may promote Venetoclax insensitivity}

While MLL-FPs are well known prevent apoptosis through \textit{BCL2} overexpression \citep{benito_mll-rearranged_2015}, additional apoptosis components may be important. The BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax is a successful treatment for \textit{MLL}r leukaemias \citep{khaw_venetoclax_2016, vandenberg_abt-199_2013}, yet there is variable response with in vitro models \citep{pan_selective_2014} and drug resistance is a concern. MLL-FP circuits may elucidate alternative mechanisms \textit{MLL}r leukaemias may prevent apoptosis and escape venetoclax treatment. To identify candidate nodes that confer resistance to venetoclax I used a CRISPR screen combined with drug treatment, performed by Max Jamilly (\cite{harman_kmt2a-aff1_2021}, see methods, \ref{fig:ch4_max}A-B). This screen was performed in THP-1 cells (MLL-AF9 AML), and while this differs from SEM (MLL-AF4 ALL) lineage switching is known to occur between ALL and AML leukaemias under selective pressure \citep{gardner_acquisition_2016, pillai_car_2019} and core regulatory logic is similar (See Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_sem-thp1}). Unfortunately due to poor reproducibility with DMSO treatment, rather than comparing T18 DMSO with T18 venetoclax, we compared T0 baseline with T18 venetoclax. As such, significant hits require additional validation (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_max}C).

Among MLL-AF4 GRN regulated genes, several sgRNA targeting central nodes were depleted (perturbation inhibits survival) after venetoclax treatment, including \textit{RUNX1} and \textit{MLL} (\textit{MLL-AF9}) (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_max}D). This suggests these core TFs generally promote cell growth and survival. Genes perturbations that promote venetoclax resistance will have enriched sgRNA after drug treatment. \textit{CASP9} (caspase-9) is the most significantly enriched hit that is also a target of a MLL-AF4:RUNX1 motif, and has been independently validated (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_max}C, E). Perturbation of caspase-9 confers survival, consistent with its role in apoptosis \citep{li_caspases_2008, li_cytochrome_1997, slee_ordering_1999}. 

\textit{CASP9} is partially repressed in a TF cascade where 96 hours' \textit{MLL-AF4} or \textit{RUNX1} KD increased expression (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_casp9}A-B). Stable KO of \textit{CASP9} in SEM cells reproduced venetoclax resistance (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_casp9}C-D, Appendix \ref{fig:app_casp9-del}). These KO lines displayed variable RUNX1 protein and mRNA levels though this did not correlate with \textit{CASP9} status, and is likely a result of clonal expansion (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_casp9}C). \textit{MLL-AF4} KDs were performed for 96 hours for robust loss of protein, however this favours secondary effects. A reduced \textit{MLL-AF4} KD for 48 hours does not reduce overall RUNX1 protein, and has little effect on \textit{CASP9} expression (P = 0.64, Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_casp9}F-G). With 48 hours' \textit{RUNX1} KD \textit{CASP9} is upregulated, in both SEM and RS4;11 cells (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_casp9}F, H-I). Together these results evidence a true MLL-AF4:RUNX1:\textit{CASP9} TF cascade, where repression is directly driven by RUNX1. Further, repression of \textit{CASP9} may reduce sensitivity to venetoclax.

This analysis presents RUNX1 as a novel target to enhance venetoclax efficacy. In fact, recent studies have noted improved venetoclax response in patients with RUNX1 mutations \citep{cherry_venetoclax_2021, chow_runx1_2021}. Treating SEM cells with a small molecule RUNX1 inhibitor (active AI-10-104, inactive AI-4-88) that disrupts RUNX1 binding to CBF$\beta$ \citep{illendula_small-molecule_2015, illendula_small_2016} resulted in partially reduced RUNX1 DNA binding and expression (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_runx1-inh}A-B). Dose-response curves were generated using variable venetoclax concentrations and 10 \microm{} RUNX1 inhibitor. Co-treatment with AI-10-104 yielded lower venetoclax IC50 (78nM) over AI-4-88 or DMSO treatment (208.97nM, 193.47nM) (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_runx1-inh}C). This preliminary analysis suggests an interaction between venetoclax and RUNX1 activity, though \textit{CASP9} levels appear unaffected by RUNX1 inhibitors (Fig. \ref{fig:ch4_runx1-inh}B). It has been proposed that RUNX1 perturbation improves venetoclax response through generally reducing the apoptotic threshold \citep{chow_runx1_2021}. A more robust experimental design is required to determine if the effect is synergistic.
